[Remnants 1]\nRemnants are mysterious objects\nthat hold powers beyond those of men.
[Remnants 2]\nNo one knows when or how Remnants\nwere created.
[Remnants 3]\nMen have used Remnants as\nbeneficial tools since ancient times.
[Remnants 4]\nTowns and kingdoms were built\naround Remnants with strong powers.
[Remnants 5]\nThe Imperial City of Undelwalt was\nthe first to be built around a Remnant.
[Remnants 6]\nA powerful Remnant can affect even\nthe environment around it.
[Remnants 7]\nIt is said that a Remnant once caused a flourishing\ncity in the Great Sand Sea to fall into ruin.
[Remnants 8]\nIn order to use the powers of a Remnant,\none must bind it to himself.
[Remnants 9]\nTo bind a Remnant, one simply needs to\nplace a hand over the Remnant and concentrate.
[Remnants 10]\nHowever, a Remnant can only be bound\nduring its Luminescence.
[Remnants 11]\nLuminescence is a natural occurence\nthat causes light to emit from a Remnant.
[Remnants 12]\nLuminescence occurs in a cycle,\nthe length differing for each Remnant.
[Remnants 13]\nA short cycle can be a few minutes,\nwhile a long cycle can take years.
[Remnants 14]\nOne known Luminescence cycle is\nthat of the Remnant Ark: three months.
[Remnants 15]\nNo one knows why Luminescence\noccurs. Perhaps it is a signal.
[Remnants 16]\nIf a Remnant is bound to someone,\nit cannot be bound by anyone else.
[Remnants 17]\nA bound Remnant can only be operated\nby whom it is bound to.
[Remnants 18]\nAn unbound Remnant is called\na Blank Remnant.
[Remnants 19]\nA Collapse is a misfortune triggered by a\nBlank Remnant being unbound for too long.
[Remnants 20]\nThe most common effect of a Collapse\nis the spawning of monsters.
[Remnants 21]\nSome forms of Collapse are said\nto affect people's minds.
[Remnants 22]\nOperating a Remnant wears away\nat the operator's soul.
[Remnants 23]\nThe core Remnants of each town\nare bound by the town's Lord.
[Remnants 24]\nThe Remnant Elysion is currently\nunbound.
[Remnants 25]\nA lord bound to a core Remnant is said\nto have a shorter lifespan than others.
[Remnants 26]\nA Remnant's size does not relate to its strength,\nthough the core Remnants have great powers.
[Remnants 27]\nIt is inferred that all Remnants were\ncreated from Elysion.
[Remnants 28]\nRemnants constantly emit resonating waves.
[Remnants 29]\nRemnants are made from an unknown\nsubstance, unaffected by space or time.
[Remnants 30]\nAn unproven theory suggests that\nRemnants are a type of life form.
[The Marshalls 1]\nThe Marshalls were an ancient clan,\ninfamous for their mysterious powers.
[The Marshalls 2]\nA Marshall did not need a focus\nobject to use mystic arts.
[The Marshalls 3]\nThe Marshalls used magick, an ancient\nability that has long been forgotten.
[The Marshalls 4]\nThe Marshalls were said to have\ndeveloped many fantastic techniques.
[The Marshalls 5]\nThe tablet discovered in Marshallton is one of\nthe last surviving relics of the Marshalls' skills.
[The Marshalls 6]\nThe Marshall tablet holds the power to seal\nand transform a Remnant into a talisman.
[The Marshalls 7]\nWhile all such transformed Remnants are called\ntalismans, the exact forms they take on differ.
[The Marshalls 8]\nIn the form of a talisman, a Remnant\nwill not trigger a Collapse.
[The Marshalls 9]\nA Remnant in talisman form can be used\nby anyone. It does not need to be bound.
[The Marshalls 10]\nThe Marshalls disappeared from history\nwith the age of the Imperator.
[The Third Committee 1]\nThe Third Committee is an Academy organization\nthat conducts illegal Remnant experiments.
[The Third Committee 2]\nProject HN:\nDevelopment of a man-made Remnant (Hypnos)
[The Third Committee 3]\nProject LO:\nUsage of a flying Remnant for the military
[The Third Committee 4]\nProject SC:\nUsage of a giant Remnant for the military
[The Third Committee 5]\nProject BA:\nFusion of a Remnant with a mitra
[World Races 1]\nThere are four main races in the world:\nmitra, yama, qsiti, and sovani.
[World Races 2]\nIt is said the sovani ruled over all\nof the other races during ancient times.
[World Races 3]\nA Marshall has the appearance of a mitra,\nbut no one truly knows what they are.
[The Fallen 1]\nA creature once feared as a wrathful god. Records\nof its existence date back hundreds of years.
[The Fallen 2]\nSome say it was created by the world itself\nas a way to rid itself of Remnants.

If there is no objection, I shall take this.
At last, it is mine.
I was able to gather them all.
Hmph... Fine; I can wait.
There you are.
This is just what I needed.
That should be the last of them.
Hmph, do as you like.
I'll take this!
All according to plan.
And that's everything I needed!
Oh no... How could you...
I'll be takin' that.
Had my eye on this for a while.
Huhhh, looks like a full set.
Keh, what's that all about?
Oh yes...it's as if it were made for me!
With this, I need nothing else.
Marvelous...with this piece, I have finished my collection!
I cannot believe such an affront!
I wanted this! ...I think.
I was looking for this! ...Right?
Then that's all the components I needed! ...Right?
Now that I think of it, maybe I didn't need that after all...
Will you entrust this item to my care?
I have received a good thing.
Good. My preparations are complete.
Regrettable, but I can endure.
Of course I'll be takin' that.
Hell yeah! I got it!
And that's the whole shebang.
Dammit! That was mine!
I understand this is to be mine?
I've hoped to acquire this.

You'll let me have this, right?

Somebody's feeling ballsy.
Oh! That's it!
Lucky me!
Yay! I've got them all!
Oh poo.
I'll be takin' my reward, then.
Good, good.
Finally, I've got the last of 'em.
It's orders, so I'll suck it up...
If nobody else needs it, guess I'll take it.
This thing, huh?
Hmph, looks like that's the last of 'em.
I'll remember that...
Mm-hmm!
This is of great importance.
Ahh...I see I've collected all I need.
Hrm...
I'll take this, thanks.
Thank the Emperor I got this.
Good. I shouldn't need any more components now.

Brilliant. This is the last component I needed.
Hrm...
Hand it over.
Perfect.

We must use this the way it was meant to be used.
At last, I can craft better equipment.
It is of little concern to me.
What am I to do with this?
I'll take this if I must.
Hmm. It seems my collection is complete.
I need nothing.
Heheh, finally, something decent.
Yes...yes! YES!!!

I see... Certainly, I wouldn't have to worry\nabout a particular weakness then.
Combat arts, for sure!

Definitely mystic arts!

Go for it!
You think? I don't know how useful it'll be,\nbut you never know until you try, right?
Nah, focus on what you've got.
Good point. Then I'll try and polish up what I\nknow so I can learn more powerful spells.
You gotta choose for yourself.
You've got a point... Kinda stings coming\nfrom a kid like you, though!

You gotta choose for yourself.
You've got a point... Kinda stings to hear it\nfrom someone younger than me, though!
Rush, how do you think I should focus my\ntraining? I've been feeling a little uncertain\nabout it...
A little of everything's good.
Hmm... Maybe you have a point.
Combat arts, for sure!
Ahh... Combat is important.
Definitely mystic arts!
Ahh... Mystic arts are useful skills.
What do you think I should focus on for\nmy training?
Go for balance.
You're right...thanks.\nNow, to work on surpassing her...
Combat arts suit you 110%.
You're right...thanks.\nNow, to work on surpassing her...
Mystic arts is the way to go.
You're right...thanks.\nNow, to work on surpassing her...
Heya, Rush! You look bored. Let's go find some\nptalk_embed
Okay!
Great! Then let's get going!
Sorry...maybe later.
Wha\nseriously?
Whoa, that\nptalk_embed\nyou've got is pretty sweet. Think I could borrow it?
Sure, no prob.
For real? Appreciate it, man.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Boo to that.
Heya, Rush! I bet you're bored like me...\nHow 'bout we go do some fighting, show\nsome monsters who's boss, eh?
Sounds like a plan.
Yeahh, that's more like it! C'mon!
Sorry... Maybe next time.
Aw, why you gotta be so cold?
So I was thinking of learning\nptalk_embed\n...\nWhadda you think, Rush?
Go for it!
Alright.\nIt'll definitely be a challenge, but that's not\ngonna stop me!
Nah, focus on what you've got.
Okay! I'll keep trainin' what I got and learn\nsome real kickass spells!
That decision's all up to you.
Ouch...that's harsh, man.

Ouch...that's harsh.
Rush, whaddya think about me focusing my\ntraining? It's enough for me to just trust in\nmy strength and my equipment, right?
You should go for balance.
Huh, that sounds good.\nThen I could do anything!
Combat arts, for sure!
Oh yeah. That's definitely my style, huh?
Definitely mystic arts!
You think so? Well, I'll do my best.
Hey, Rush, what do you think I should focus\nmy training on? I'm worried I'm holding\nthe others back...
Do it all\nflexibility is good!
Yeah... It suits me, too, I think.\nAwright, no more of this wishy-washy bull.\nLet's go, Rush!
Combat arts suit you 110%.
Yeah... It suits me, too, I think.\nAwright, no more of this wishy-washy bull.\nLet's go, Rush!
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Yeah... It suits me, too, I think.\nAwright, no more of this wishy-washy bull.\nLet's go, Rush!
Rush, my boy, I've found myself in need of\nptalk_embed\nHave we the time to obtain one?
Sure.
Excellent! Then let's get a move on.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Rush, would you lend me your\nptalk_embed\nfor a while?
Sure, no prob.
So generous! I appreciate it.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
I never imagined you so petty...
Oh, Rush. If you've some free time, why\ndon't we fight a bit outside of town?\nSitting around all day isn't good for you...
Yeah, let's hit it!
As I expected from you! Let's be off!
Kinda busy, sorry.
Hum... Slack on your training and you'll find\nyour body rebelling when you really need it.
Hmm... Learn\nptalk_embed\nOr continue polishing what I know?\nI'm curious, Rush, what do you think?
Try something new!
Hmm! I always have loved learning.
Focus on what you know.
Jack-of-all-trades, master of none, as they\nsay...\nThen I'll work on mastering the areas I do know.
That decision's all up to you.
I tip my hat to you... It's just as you say.

That decision's all up to you.
I tip my hat to you... It's just as you say.
Rush, what do you think I should focus on?\nIs it really enough to maximize my command\nof mystic arts?
Learn a little bit of everything.
I see...\nI suppose that would avoid being too one-sided.
Combat arts, for sure!
I see... Combat arts are quite dependable.
Definitely mystic arts!
Exactly! Goodness, look at me, doing all this\nworrying over nothing...
Rush, what do you think I should focus on?\nI fear I'm not able to help the others as I should...
Go for balance.
Thank you, Rush.\nYou've helped me make a decision.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush.\nYou've helped me make a decision.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush.\nYou've helped me make a decision.
Rush, I have need of a\nptalk_embed\nIs there time to obtain one?
Yeah, let's go.
Excellent.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see.
Would you allow me to borrow your\nptalk_embed
Sure, no prob.
Thank you.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
Do we have time to engage some monsters?\nIt would not do to slack on training.
Sounds like a plan.
Mm. Let's go.
Kinda busy, sorry.
You'll never become stronger with that attitude.
To learn\nptalk_embed\n...\nI've found I cannot decide whether it's worth taking\nenergy from my current disciplines.
Go for it!
Heh. Of course.
Focus on what you've got!
Then I shall concentrate on higher-level\nspells in the areas I already study.
You should choose, not me.
Oho... You're full of surprises.

Go for it!
Heh. Of course.
Just polish what you've got.
Then I shall concentrate on higher-level\ntechniques in the areas I already study.
You should decide.
Oho... You're full of surprises.
Am I properly focusing my training? In times\nlike this, my lack of discipline could be the\ndifference between success and failure for Athlum...
You should go for balance.
Certainly that is the best path for a sovani...
Combat arts, for sure!
Becoming a specialist in man-to-man combat,\nthen? Certainly not a bad thing...
Definitely mystic arts!
Focusing the spirit... I admit, this is my personal\npreference.
I wonder... Is there a way I can focus my training to\nbe more effective? There must be a way to be more\nhelpful to Lord David...
Balance is the key.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.\nI'll go forward...for Athlum.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.\nI'll go forward...for Athlum.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.\nI'll go forward...for Athlum.
There's something I need, young one\nptalk_embed\nCome with me to find it.
Okay, sure.
Good. Let's head out.
Sorry...maybe later.
Harumph.
Young one, your\nptalk_embed\n...\nI'd like to put it to good use...
It's all yours.
Appreciated.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Harumph.
You look free, young one.\nInstead of wasting time here, we should hit\nthe battlefield!
Sounds like a plan.
Then, follow me.
Kinda busy, sorry.
And you wonder why you're so weak.
Hmm... Learn\nptalk_embed\nOr continue polishing what I know?\nWhat's the wiser choice?
Don't run from a challenge!
A challenge, hmm? Fine, I'll give it a shot.
Go with what you know.
Hum. As I'd decided from the start.\nAfter a bit more practice, I'll show you some\ntruly amazing spells.
You gotta choose for yourself.
You don't know either, do you...
Hmm... Learn\nptalk_embed\nOr continue polishing what I know?\nWhat's the wiser choice?

You don't know either, do you...
What should I focus on from now on?\nI'm not worried or anything, just curious...
Do it all!
That is an option...
Combat arts, for sure!
Mm... I, too, was thinking I would need to\nbecome even stronger...
Definitely mystic arts!
Mmm... Mystic arts aren't anything to laugh at,\neither, I suppose...
So... Where should I go from here?\nI can only go forward, but in what direction?
Balance is the key.
Mmm... I see.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Mmm... I see.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Mmm... I see.
ptalk_embed\n...\nThat's what I need. Do you think we'd\nhave time to pick one up?
Sure, no prob.
Really? Great!\nLet's get going!
Sorry...maybe later.
Oh? That's too bad.
Say, Rush, could I have a look at your\nptalk_embed\nfor a little while? I'd like to conduct some testing...
Sure, no prob.
Are you sure? Thanks!
Ehh... I need it right now.
Ahh...
Rush, do you think we'd have some time to go\nbattle some? I think I'm on the verge of a\nnew discovery!
Sounds like a plan.
Great! Then let's go.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Ah, I see.\nMaybe next time.
Should I start\nptalk_embed\nOr stick with what I've already been learning?\nWhat do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
You think so? Alright. I'll do my best!
Go with what you know.
Ahh, I see.\nAlright, I'll concentrate on the areas I\nalready study for now.
You should choose, not me.
I see... Let me give it some more thought.
Should I learn\nptalk_embed\nOr continue to practice what I already know?\nWhat do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright!\nThis should be an interesting experiment...
Just polish what you've got.
Alright. I'll focus on the areas I know...\nI'm sure there's a lot more knowledge to\nbe gleaned.
You should decide.
You have a point...\nLet me put a little more thought into it.
Rush, what do you think I should be focusing\non? I've been a little worried, lately...
Being well-rounded is good!
Yes... If you can do a little of everything,\ntravel isn't much of an obstacle...
Combat arts, for sure!
When things get tough, that sort of strength\ncan be useful, I guess.
Definitely mystic arts!
Sounds helpful to Remnant research!
Say, Rush, what areas do you think I should\nfocus on? I'm curious to hear your opinion.
Do it all\nflexibility is good!
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into\nconsideration and do my best!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into\nconsideration and do my best!
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into\nconsideration and do my best!
What's good? I'm thinking we should get some\nptalk_embed\nIt'll be the jump-off.
Alrighty!
Word. Then let's roll.
Sorry, man, maybe later.
You're wyling.
Oh, so that\nptalk_embed\nyou got? You're gonna let me borrow it, right?
Sure, no prob.
Props, man. That's chill.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Punk.
You trying to get your battle on or something?\nI like kicking ass, not sitting on it.
Yeah, I'm game.
Cool. Let's bounce then.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Pathetic.
So I guess I could learn\nptalk_embed\nbut it kinda sounds like a waste of time...
No way\ngo for it!
Alright. Then I'll try to get it down ASAP.
Yeah, I'd give it a pass.
Alright. Polishing what I already know ain't\ngonna hurt anything.
I dunno... What do you think?
I think I asked you for your opinion...\nWhatever.
Was thinking of learning\nptalk_embed\n...\nWhadda you think?
Yeah, I'd go for it!
Alright. With some more arts under my belt\nI'd be sick on the battlefield.
Nah, work on what you've got.
What, you think I'm fallin' off?\n...Nah, I hear you. I need to lock down the\narts I already know.
Whatever you want.
Wow. How unhelpful.
What should I focus on from now on...\nEh? Just talking to myself, never mind.
All-rounder, natch.
Sounds quick and easy.
Combat arts, for sure!
Yeahhh...that sounds about right.
Definitely mystic arts!
Huh... Maybe.
Sup, Rush. I was just thinking about what\nsort of training I should focus on...\nNot that you gotta worry about that.
Balance is the key.
Mmm...\nSorry for underestimating you all this time.\nFrom now on it's on!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Mmm...\nSorry for underestimating you all this time.\nFrom now on it's on!
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Mmm...\nSorry for underestimating you all this time.\nFrom now on it's on!
Rush, I need a favor... I am looking for the\nptalk_embed\nI thought together we could find it, perhaps in the blink\nof an eye.
Alrighty!
Really? You are a lifesaver.
Sorry...maybe later.
How unfortunate...
Your\nptalk_embed\nis impressive... Yet it would be even more so in my\npossession. What do you think?
...Sure, you can borrow it.
You have my eternal gratitude.\nIt shall be used spectacularly.
No, I need to hold onto it.
So cold... Believe me when I say that the ladies\nprefer a man who is warm...if not blazing hot.
Rush... Shall we proceed to the field of battle\nand wreak havoc upon the monster hordes?\nI...must become someone she can depend on...
Sounds like a plan.
Excellent!\nMy arm sings with the promise of victory!
Busy now, sorry.
Do you truly think you will attract a lover\nwith an attitude like that?
I have the chance to add\nptalk_embed\nto my repertoire... Should I?
Go for it!
I don't want to be known as a man afraid of\ncommitment... Yet I shall attempt this new\ntype of skill.
Nah, I'd give it a pass.
I see. Then I shall focus on what I already know.\nSoon the most beautiful spells you have ever\nseen shall be mine to command!
Whatever you want, dude.
You...you think I'm unreliable, don't you...
ptalk_embed\n...\nShould I begin to study it? Or focus on what I\nalready know?
Try something new!
A true man isn't tempted by every new face that\ncrosses his path... And yet there is something to\nbe said for...fresh experiences.
Just polish what you've got.
I see. Then I shall focus on what I already know.\nSoon the most beautiful techniques you have ever\nseen shall be mine to command!
Decide that for yourself.
I see... The answer lies within me, waiting for Fate\nherself to pluck it from my tender breast...\nI shall give her the time she needs.
What should I focus my training on? Alas, it is\ntoo much for me to even select a single maid\nto lay my affections on...
Being well-rounded is good!
I see... The best of both worlds, as it were.
Combat arts, for sure!
Combat, hm?\nI suppose I am a bit of a swashbuckler.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells, hm?\nI must admit, I am not poor at the mystic arts.
Rush Sykes! I know you see me as unreliable...\nThus, I ask you\nwhat should I focus my training on?
All 'rounder is the way to go.
Ahh... Yes, you are right.\nAnd now it is time I did what I must do.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Ahh... Yes, you are right.\nAnd now it is time I did what I must do.

Do you have a moment? Have you heard of\nptalk_embed\nI think I need one. Shall we search?
Sure, let's go.
Oho. You're a big help.
Sorry...maybe later.
Alright. I'm in no hurry.
What is that...\nptalk_embed\n...\nWould you lend it to me for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Are you certain? I thank you.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
I feel like I'm getting dull and flabby...\nShall we fight some monsters for a bit?
Sounds like a plan.
I see you are also a fan of combat.
Kinda busy, sorry.
Ahh... You looked free... My mistake.
Hmm... Learn\nptalk_embed\nOr continue polishing what I know?\nWhat's the wiser choice?
Try something new!
Yes...\nPerhaps I could remember something I've lost...
Focus on what you've got!
Ahh... So, I should focus my training on becoming\nmore proficient in the areas I know.
You should decide.
Ah...I see.

Ah...I see.
What path should I follow from now on? I don't\neven remember the one I took to get to this point...
All-rounder, natch.
Ahh... With that, no need to worry.
Combat arts, for sure!
My body should remember that...I hope.
Mystic arts, for sure.
My body should remember that...I hope.
What do you think I should focus on from\nnow on?\nI value your opinion.
Do it all\nflexibility is good!
Yes...yes.\nI will keep this in mind as I go forward.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Yes...yes.\nI will keep this in mind as I go forward.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Yes...yes.\nI will keep this in mind as I go forward.
Master Sykes, might I trouble you for a moment?\nI seek a\nptalk_embed\nand hoped that you might assist me in obtaining one.
Sure, let's go.
As always, I appreciate your help.
Sorry...maybe later.
Understood... A pity.
Master Sykes, might you be willing to lend me your\nptalk_embed
No prob!
Ohh!\nAs always, I appreciate your generosity.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
I never thought\nAh, nothing. Forget I said anything.
Master Sykes, would you accompany me to\nthe nearest battlefield? Even at this age,\nit is poor form to shirk one's training.
Yeah, let's go!
I appreciate your indulgence.\nLet us go at once.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Shall I attempt to learn\nptalk_embed\nor focus on areas I already know? At this age,\nit's no small matter to make a decision either way...
Try something new!
You are right...\nI am far too old for pusillanimity!
Stick to what you know.
Understood. I shall focus my training on\nproceeding further down the paths of\nthe mystic arts I already know.
You should decide.
Touché. Forgive my show of weakness...\nYou are truly wise beyond your years.

Touché. Forgive my show of weakness...\nYou are truly wise beyond your years.
How should I focus my training from now on?\nI've found myself plagued with uncertainties\nof late, thus I'd value your opinion, Master Sykes.
All-rounder, natch.
There is truth to your words...\nA knight must be able to perform any task.
Combat arts, for sure!
A knight without a proper command of\ncombat arts is but a disgrace.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells can be useful tools in saving lives.
Master Sykes, do you think there's a better way I\ncould be focusing my training? Even at this age,\nI sometimes wonder...
Balance is the key.
I am prepared.\nAs a knight of the Order of Melphina, I will\nact proudly and without shame.
Combat arts is the way to go.
I am prepared. As a knight of the Order of\nMelphina, I will act proudly and without\nshame.

Hey, I need some\nptalk_embed\nIf you got time to sit around and talk, you've\ngot time to go get some eh?
Yeah, let's go.
Arright. C'mon.
Sorry...maybe later.
Ah. Don't wanna be seen with me, eh?\nDon't blame you.
So, how about your\nptalk_embed\nWhy don'tcha let me take care of it for a while?
Sure, no prob.
F'r real? You're alright.
I kinda need it right now.
And this is why I hate people.
All this sitting around is making me nervous...\nWhat say we pick up some battles, hmm?
Sounds like a plan.
Good. Let's go.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
*snort*
Guess I could learn\nptalk_embed\nbut it sounds like a waste of time...
No way\ngo for it!
Huh. Guess I'll see if it's useful after all.
Yeah, I'd give it a pass.
Polish up what I already got, eh?
You should decide.
...Right. Forget I asked.
Was thinking of learning\nptalk_embed\n...\nWhadda you think?
Yeah, I'd go for it!
Alright. I'll give it a go.
Nah, work on what you've got.

You should decide.
...Right. Forget I asked.
Hey. You think I'm trainin' in the right things?\n...Ridiculous, ain't it? A bandit worrying about\nthis type of stuff...
Being well-rounded is good!
Yeah?\nGuess there ain't no weakness in that.
Combat arts, for sure!
Yeah?\nGuess I'm pretty used to hefting weapons\naround.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Yeah... I saw the usefulness of mystic arts\nfirsthand when I was actively banditing.
So, whadda you think I should be training in?\nWanna know what you think.
Do it all\nflexibility is good!
Okay. For Reya... And, for friends...\nI'll give it a shot.
Combat arts is the way to go.

Rush, I have need of a\nptalk_embed\nHave we the time to obtain one?
Yeah, let's go.
You have my gratitude. Let us be off.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Rush, might you lend me your\nptalk_embed\nI promise to put it to good use.
Sure, no prob.
Are you certain? I appreciate your generosity.
I kinda need it right now.
Ahh...I see.
Rush, have we time to do some fighting at\nthe nearest battlefield? I still must prove to\nmy father that I can be a competent knight...
Alright, sure.
You have my gratitude. Let us be off.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Ought I learn\nptalk_embed\nOr continue my current studies? What do you think, Rush?
Sure! Try something new.
Alright.\nI shall do my best to master this new field.
Stick to what you know.
As you say.\nI shall further refine those spells I do know.
Decide that for yourself.
As you say...\nIf Father were to hear of my indecisiveness,\nhe would be much displeased...

Rush, may I ask you something? Do you\nthink I'm following the right path in my\ntraining? Where should I have my focus?
You should go for balance.
Certainly, attempting everything leaves no\ndeficiency.
Combat arts, for sure!
Focus on the art of combat, ah? Certainly,\nthat is necessary for a future ruler...
Mystic arts, for sure.
I see.\nCertainly it is important to master the mystic arts.
Spells, combat arts, or a mix of the two...\nWhat ought to be my main focus? It is not\nan easy decision.
Balance is the key.
Thank you. From now on I shall work hard to\nearn the trust of the people of Royotia.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Thank you. From now on I shall work hard to\nearn the trust of the people of Royotia.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Thank you. From now on I shall work hard to\nearn the trust of the people of Royotia.
Rush, you know\nptalk_embed\nright? Well, I was hoping maybe we could go find\nsome if it wasn't too much trouble...
Yeah, let's go.
Really? Thank you so much.\nLet's go, alright?
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Maybe some other time.
Um, Rush...\nYour\nptalk_embed\n...\nDo you think I could use it for a bit?
No prob!
It's really okay?\nThank you so much...
I kinda need it right now.
Oh...
Rush, do you think we might be able to\nbattle some monsters for a bit? I don't\nwant to get too rusty...
Sounds good to me.
Thank you.\nThen, shall we be off?
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Ah, I see.\nWell, maybe next time...
Should I learn\nptalk_embed\nOr just continue my studies? What do you think, Rush?
Go for it!
You think so? Okay...I'll do my best.
Focus on what you've got!
Ahh...that makes sense. I'll try to refine\nthe spells I know to be more powerful.
Decide that for yourself.
Ah... You're right. If I can't even decide\nthis for myself, how can I help Kate...
Should I learn\nptalk_embed\nOr just continue my studies? What do you think, Rush?

You should decide.
Ah... You're right. If I can't even decide\nthis for myself, how can I help Kate...
Rush, do you have a moment? I can't\ndecide how I should focus my training...
All-rounder, natch.
Makes sense...\nI wouldn't have to choose either way, would I?
Combat arts, for sure!
Combat, huh? I'd better start working out...
Mystic arts, for sure.
Oh? I guess I'm not that bad at them.
Rush, how should I focus my training\nfrom now on? Kate won't help me at all...
Balance is the key.

Sure, no prob.
I appreciate it.
Ehh... I need it right now.

Sounds like a plan.
Excellent. Then, let's not waste any time.
Sorry... Maybe next time.
To refuse a lady...!
Hmm... Shall I learn\nptalk_embed\nOr continue with my current studies?\nWhich is the wiser choice?
Try something new!
If you say so. I'll do my best to make it\nworthwhile.

Like, totally for sure!
Sweet! This is totally not uncool of you.
Like, no.
That sucks!
So, like, your\nptalk_embed\n...\nYou should totally give it to me.
Okay...
Wow. You're so attentive to my needs.\nDo you like me or something?
Ha ha ha. No.
Ugh. Cheapass.
Who likes loot? I do!\nSo, let's go to the battlefield and get some!
Sounds like a plan.
Like, thanks!
Sorry...maybe later.
Refused? Fail.
ptalk_embed\n...\nI bet you don't even know this type of mystic arts?\nbut, like, I'm thinking I should learn it.
Yeah! You go, girl.
Like, here's a tip?\nNever say that again.
Work on your current spells.
Really? ...Okay, fine.\nI'll just totally max out my spell power then.
If that's what you want.
Wow. Being passive-aggressive?\nSooo last year.
So, I was wondering if I should learn\nptalk_embed\n...\nI mean, there's other stuff I could be doing...
Go for it!
Okay...\nHopefully this won't be a complete waste of time.
Stick with what you know.
Really? ...Okay, fine.\nI'll just totally max out my spell power then.
Only you can decide that.
You sound just like an old woman!\nI'd say it was adorable, except that it's not.
Geez, did you know it like takes a lot of work to\nbecome a witch, or whatever?\nWhat should I train in the meantime?
Do it all!
An awesome witch like me had better know\nsome of everything, right?
Combat arts, for sure!
Like, seriously? You do know that witch\nequals mystic stuff, right?
Mystic arts, for sure.
Amirite? Like, cutie witch Khrynia is def\ndown with the mystic arts.
Okay, Rush\nwhat do you think I should focus\nmy training on? I know, it's hard to believe,\nbut I want your opinion.
Balance is the key.

Thanks for nothing, punk.
So, you gonna let me borrow your\nptalk_embed\nor what?
Okay.
Seriously? You aren't half bad.
What.
Ha ha, what a comedian. Asshat.
Hey, how 'bout we go fight some monsters, eh?\nUnlike Rhagoh, I actually like kicking ass.
Sounds good to me.
Awright!\nLet's hit it!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Tsk... Whatever.
You think it's worth it to try learning\nptalk_embed\nWhat would you do?
Try something new!
Alright, I'll give it a shot.\nSpells aren't my strong suit though.
Stick with what you know!
Makes sense. I'll try and polish up what\nI do know to learn more powerful spells.
Decide that for yourself.
You're right. Geez, I sound like Rhagoh.
You think it's worth it to try learning\nptalk_embed\nWhat would you do?

All-rounder, natch.
Makes sense...\nDon't have to choose just one, eh?
Combat arts, for sure!
Figured you'd say that.\nIt is my specialty, after all.
Definitely mystic arts!
Eh? That's more Rhagoh's bag, but eh,\nI'll give it a shot.
What sort of training do you think I should focus on?
Go for balance.
Alright, sounds good. Should be able to make\nup for Rhagoh's slacking, at least.
You're a natural-born fighter.

Just polish what you've got.
I know, right? I'll polish what I know until\nthey're the shining star I am! ...Or whatever.

Sure, no prob.
Ho ho ho. You have my gratitude.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Coldblooded...
Rush, do we have time to do some fighting\nat the nearest battlefield? My usual training\ndoesn't feel like it was enough today...
Sounds like a plan.
Ho ho ho!\nThis should be fun!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
...
Should I learn\nptalk_embed\nOr continue to refine what I already know?\nWhat do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Ho ho ho... Alright.\nLet's see what these old bones can do.
Focus on what you've got!
Hum, hum, I see, I see!\nThen, I'll continue to train so that I can learn\nmore powerful spells.

Ho ho ho, there wouldn't be anything to worry\nabout in that case, ah.
Focus on combat arts!
Alright!\nBelieve it or not, I was an army general! I have\nutmost confidence in my abilities.

Let's go!
All according to plan.\nLet us go.
Sorry... Maybe another time.
Rrgh...
Study\nptalk_embed\n, or\nto continue one's current studies? ...I realize thinking is\ntrying for you, but what would you do?
Anything new is worth trying!
Heh. Obviously I had already planned to do that.
Focus on what you know.
Learn more powerful forms of the mystic arts\nI know? Of course I've decided to do that.
You gotta choose for yourself.
What a pathetically mitra-like answer.
Learn\nptalk_embed\na brand-new technique, or continue honing my current\nskills? You may give your opinion this one and only time.

Sorry...maybe later.
A pity.
Would you allow me to borrow your\nptalk_embed
No prob!
Thank you. You've been a big help.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Forgive me. I spoke out of turn.
Rush, do we have time to engage some monsters?\nIt would not do to slack on training.
Sounds like a plan.
Ahh.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see...
Should I learn\nptalk_embed\nOr continue to refine what I already know?\nWhat do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
As you say. It should be helpful knowledge.
Focus on what you've got!
Understood. I'll focus on polishing the spells\nI know to be as strong as possible.
You should decide.
I was told that before, once...

The Union Board has areas for lead ranks and back ranks.\nGenerally, the front three rows are for the lead ranks, while\nthe rear two are for back ranks. The lead ranks are best at\ndealing and defending against physical damage, while the\nback ranks are good for mystic attacks and defense.
A formation's strength depends on the members of the\nunion performing it. Some characters are particularly\neffective in certain formations. Try different\ncombinations and see what happens!
Change locations through the\nworld map\n. By selecting\na place on the map, you can instantly travel there.

Deadlock
When unions are caught in close combat, it is\nknown as\nDeadlock\n. In such situations, the two\nsides must battle until only one is left.
While in\nDeadlock\ntargeting is limited\nOnly adjacent unions may be targeted.
When targets are changed to adjacent unions, certain\ncommands can break Deadlock. When breaking free\nfrom Deadlock, the opposing union has a free chance\nto attack. Don't act too rashly in these situations!
A Mystic Chance\ngives the opportunity to learn a new\nMystic Art, or level up an existing Mystic Art. You may\nchoose the art you would like to learn from a list.

Battle
Each entity in a battle is called a\nunit\nThese units are organized into groups, called\nunions
In battle, you will\ncommand friendly unions for\nlarge-scale assaults\n. The specific directions you may\ngive are displayed as\nbattle commands
At the top right of the screen is a\nbattle\nnavigation map\nshowing the positions of\nall unions engaged in battle.
Available battle commands change depending on\nconditions such as the positions and makeup of\nfriendly and enemy unions. Keep these conditions in\nmind to give appropriate battle orders.
Morale
The large red and blue bar across the top of the screen\nis called the\nMorale Gauge\n. It measures you and your\nenemies' will to fight.
As morale rises, attacks become stronger and more\neffective. Conversely, as morale falls, defenses weaken\nand unions do less damage.
Morale fluctuates\nbased on the performance of both\nsides in battle\n. Make it a habit to keep track of your\ntroops' morale.
Critical Trigger
Sometimes during battle, a\nTrigger Chance\nwill occur.\nDuring a Trigger Chance, you'll be given a brief opportunity\nto press a certain button on the controller.\nA well-timed button press will launch a\nCritical Trigger\ngiving your side a definite advantage in battle.
Successful Trigger Chances while on the attack will\nlaunch a\nCritical Offense\n. This will cause the next\nfriendly unit to act faster than usual.
Successful Trigger Chances while being attacked\nlaunch a\nCritical Defense\n. This can change a simple\nblock to a shield bash, or a dodge to a counterattack.
If you find you just can't keep up with the timing,\nCritical Triggers can be switched to occur\nautomatically through the Config Menu.
Critical Trigger Settings\nhave been added to\nthe Config Menu!
Guest Unions
When a\nguest union\njoins the party,\nyou cannot assign\nit battle commands\nit acts on its own. See if you can\ndetermine how to support your guest in battles!
Enemy Advantage
If you are touched by a monster in the field,\nthe following battle will be to the\nenemy's\nadvantage\n. This can be avoided by\nengaging\nmonsters\nin battle yourself.
KO
A union's HP is the sum of each member's HP.\nInstead of worrying about the HP of individual\nunits, watch that of the union instead. If the\nunion's HP falls to 0, then the whole union is\nIncapacitated\n, and will be unable to act.
Botch
If a union's leader falls in battle, it is a\nBotch\nAfterwards, that union can no longer accept battle\ncommands, meaning the remaining members\ncannot be commanded.
Flank Attack
When in Deadlock, if a union is attacked from the\nside, it is known as a\nFlank Attack\n. It is possible\nto be flanked by two unions at a time.\nUnions performing Flank Attacks deal extra damage
Rear Assault
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by\ntwo unions, any further unions Deadlocking the\nvictim union launch a\nRear Assault\nUnions performing Rear Assaults deal extra damage
Massive Strike
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by\ntwo unions and Rear Assaulted by a third, any\nfurther unions Deadlocking the victim union\nlaunch a\nMassive Strike\nUnions participating\nin a Massive Strike deal extra damage
Deadlock Interference
If an enemy union is attempting to Deadlock a\nfriendly union but instead is caught in Deadlock\nitself, this is called\nInterference\nWhen it's the player's side that gets caught,\nit is called\nInterception
Raidlock
It is possible to force a union into Deadlock without\nbeing physically nearby. This is called a\nRaidlock\nDamage dealt increases during a Raidlock.
Directing units to use mystic attacks will make\nthem\nchannel energy through their weapons to\nperform mystic arts\n. Mystic arts encompass\neverything from long-range attacks to recovery\nspells. However, they can take a long time to cast.
When you direct units to do physical attacks, they'll\nattack with their equipped weapon, or perform\ncombat arts\n. You can learn different combat arts\ndepending on your wield style, so try different\ncombinations and see what happens.

LOCATION TIPS DUMMY
Action Point\nStrategies\nEvery time a unit performs arts in battle, AP is consumed.\nHowever,\nAP is recovered each turn\n, so don't feel like\nyou have to go out of your way to conserve it.\nItem arts consume materials, and thus do not consume AP.
Each character in battle is called a\nunit\n, and can be\ngrouped into\nunions\nthrough the Union Board on the\nmain menu.\nUnions share aggregate HP and AP, and\nact as a single entity in battle\n. A union's makeup can\nhave a dramatic impact on battles. Try different combos!
Units can be grouped into unions through the\nUnion Board\non the main menu. By arranging unions,\nyou can\ncover the units' specific weaknesses and take\nadvantage of their strengths\n. There are countless\ncombinations of units\ntry to find the most effective ones.
The myriad skills a unit learns are known as\narts\nArts become more powerful as they are used.\nFrequently using arts in the same category\nenables the user to learn stronger arts of that category.
Rush is able to learn many types of arts.\nBy focusing on\narmed combat\n, he learns\ncombat arts\nBy finding\ngems\nthat allow one to focus mystic\nenergy, he may learn\nmystic arts\n. By finding\nrecipes\nfor crafting, he can learn\nitem arts
Special physical attacks performed with weapons are\ncalled\ncombat arts\n. Combat arts differ based on the\nequipped weapon and wield style. Make certain to do\nplenty of experimentation if you wish to get them all.
Channeling arcane energy through weapons is known\nas\nmystic arts\n. Mystic arts encompass a wide range\nof skills, from long-range attacks to recovery spells.\nHowever, they take time to cast, requiring some degree\nof planning.
Invocations\nare close-range mystic attack spells.\nEvocations\nare long-range mystic attack spells.\nHexes\nare status-affecting support spells.\nRemedies\nare spells that recover status or HP.\nPsionics\nallow casters to control the actions of foes.\nWards\nallow casters to support allies.
Item arts\nare skills using consumables to create\nuseful things such as potions or herbs. Item arts\nconsume items instead of AP, and are relatively\nquick to cast. Consumables can be found in specialty\nshops, or by harvesting in the field.
Herbs\ncombine plants for recovery.\nPotions\ncombine liquids for useful supplements.\nLotions\ncombine medicines to make healing balms.\nExplosives\ncombine explosive powders.\nShards\ncan be fused and used for attacks.\nTraps\nare made from special parts to trip up the foe.
The\none-handed\nwield style is speedy and allows for\nusers to equip a shield. However, its attack power is low.\nPower grip\nwield style has increased\nstrength, but attacks take longer.\nDual wield\nstyle is unmatched in attack\npower, but makes it nigh impossible to avoid attacks.
Sovani can\nquad wield\n, using four weapons at once\nfor crushing attack strength. Their\ndual power grip\ndelivers even more powerful blows. However, both\ntypes of attacks take longer to pull off.
Certain battle commands can allow a unit to change\nwield styles during battle. This is limited by the type\nof weapon the unit currently has equipped. For\nexample, if a unit equips a two-handed weapon,\nit cannot change its wield style from two-handed.
Equipment comes in four sizes: small, midsize, large,\nand huge. In general, the sizes are split by race:\nqsiti small and midsize, mitra midsize and large,\nand yama large and huge. Sovani are limited to\nspecial sovani weapons, and do not use shields.
When units are placed on the Union Board, they may\nbe arranged in special patterns called\nformations\nFormations grant unions certain effects in battle\nThey are learnt and improved through special items\nfound across the world, so keep an eye out.
When units are placed in a formation,\nunits in the\nlead ranks have increased physical attack and defense\nwhile\nunits in the back ranks have increased\nmystic attack and defense\n. Keep this in\nmind when arranging your units.
Some formations can level up when certain\nconditions are met. While formations already grant\ncertain bonuses to different stats, these\nvariant\nformations\nwill grant even greater bonuses.
When unions are caught in close combat, it is\nknown as\nDeadlock\n. In such situations, the two\nunions are set in what they may target. If a Deadlocked\nunion is commanded to perform long-range attacks,\nsupport skills, or movements, Deadlock is broken.
Canceling Deadlock leaves a union wide open to\nattack and gives the opposite union a large\ndamage bonus. Keep this in mind.
If a Deadlocked union is melee attacked from the\nside, it is known as a\nFlank Attack\n. It is possible\nto be flanked by two unions at a time.\nUnions performing Flank Attacks deal extra damage.
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by\ntwo unions, any further union Deadlocking the\nvictim union launches a\nRear Assault\nUnions performing Rear Assaults deal extra damage.
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by\ntwo unions and Rear Assaulted by a third, any\nfurther unions Deadlocking the victim union\nlaunch a\nMassive Strike\nUnions participating\nin a Massive Strike deal extra damage
Some special unions, such as those containing certain\nextremely large units, are able to Deadlock multiple unions\nat once. This is called a\nMulti Deadlock
A union victim to a Flank Attack, Rear Assault, or\nMassive Strike will be hit for additional damage.\nThe damage bonus for Rear Assault and Massive\nStrike is greater than that for Flank Attack.
It is possible to force a union into Deadlock without\nbeing physically near. This is called a\nRaidlock\nWhile raiding, the target union is hit for extra damage,\nbut the raid only lasts for one turn.
Weapons come in three main categories, dealing certain types of damage:\n* Swords and katana, or\nblades\n, mainly deal\nslashing damage\n* Axes and maces, or\nbreakers\n, mainly deal\nmauling damage\n* Spears and staves, or\npolearms\n, mainly deal\nbludgeoning\nor\npiercing damage\nBe mindful of the types of weapons units equip when forming unions.
Weapons also have\nattack strength\nparry rate\nweight\n, and\ndamage absorption\nstats.\n* Attack strength affects the amount of damage dealt.\n* Parry rate affects the likelihood of Critical Triggers.\n* Weight affects the action order.\n* Damage absorption alleviates the HP lost by attacks.\nWhile not all of these stats display in menus, be mindful\nof units' weapons when forming unions.
Weapons and combat arts all deal\nslashing\nbludgeoning\nmauling\n, or\npiercing damage\nThese attributes can add to the damage dealt to a target.
If a union's leader falls in battle, it is a\nBotch\nAfterwards,\nthat union can no longer accept battle\ncommands\n, meaning the remaining members\ncannot be commanded.
If a unit has a single one-handed weapon equipped,\nit may also equip a shield. Shields are beneficial\nfor\nevading attacks
When a unit continues to engage and defeat enemies,\nbattle chain\nis formed. As chains become higher,\nplayer units grow at a faster rate. Getting ambushed\nor returning to the World Map will break the chain.
A count is kept of the\nnumber of enemy units\ndefeated per battle\n. As this count rises, the amount\nand quality of loot dropped by the monsters rises as well.
Necklaces\ntend to raise mystic defense.\nRings\ntend to raise intellect.\nBracelets\ntend to raise HP.\nEarrings\ntend to raise physical defense.\nBelts\ntend to raise strength.\nAnklets\ntend to raise speed.\nAmulets\ntend to raise AP.
Gems\nare special types of accessories\ngranting benefits like no other.
Sometimes after defeating a monster, you may capture\nit, and the option is given to split it into component\nitems. Alternately, monsters may be sold intact to\nshops for a high price. Choose to split or not depending\non your need.
Selling captured monsters to shops increases your\ncommerce points\n. Once your commerce points\nhave reached a certain level, shops will begin offering\ntrade goods
Certain items gained by harvesting or defeating\nmonsters are known as\ncomponents\n. Components\ncan be used at customization shops to enhance\nor create new equipment. Some components may\nalso be purchased.
Components can be gained by splitting captured\nmonsters for parts. In fact, some components can\nonly be obtained in this manner. Moving the cursor\nover captured monsters on the battle results screen\nwill show what items would be gained upon splitting them.
Some components can be gained by disassembling\nweapons at customization shops. In fact, some\ncomponents can only be obtained in this manner.\nMoving the cursor over the equipment while in the\ncustomization shop menu will show what items\nwould be gained upon disassembling it.
Some monsters will not drop components until\nyou have acquired certain rare items.
Each unit has its own\nstats\nStrength, Intellect, and Speed.\nStrength\naffects physical attack and defense.\nIntellect\naffects mystic attack and defense.\nSpeed\naffects action order and evasion.\nEach unit's stats affect the performance of the\nwhole union, so keep them in mind.
Units improve their stats by participating in battles.\nHarsher monsters give players bigger boosts.
Each character has his own unique stat. Even if it seems\nto be useless at first glance, the time may come when it\nhas a significant effect.
Performance in battle affects units' morale. As one\nmight expect, high morale increases performance,\nwhile units with low morale are not as effective.\nThe morale of both the friendly and enemy forces\nis displayed across the top of the screen.
If a Critical Offense is successful as part of a\ncombo\nthe next player unit to act is bumped up to the next\naction, and will also be granted a Critical Offense.\nAdditionally, the attack of the final unit to act in that\nunion will deal a critical hit.
When a targeted unit successfully blocks an attack\nwith a weapon, the damage it would have received\nis completely nullified. Sometimes, the Critical Defense\nParry\nis performed, not only nullifying damage but\ninflicting Blacked Out status on the attacker.
When a unit successfully blocks an attack with a\nshield, the damage it would have received is\ncompletely nullified. Sometimes, the Critical\nDefense\nShield Bash\nis performed, not only\nnullifying damage but inflicting damage on the\nattacker.
When a unit successfully dodges an attack, the\ndamage it would have received is completely\nnullified. Sometimes, the Critical Defense\nCounterattack\nis performed, not only\nnullifying damage, but inflicting damage on the\nattacker.
* When a unit is\nBlacked Out\nit cannot act or react until the turn ends.\nPetrification\nmeans the unit is turning to stone.\nEach damaging attack has a chance to cause KO.\nShocked\nunits have 0 defense against\nthunder and do not get Critical Triggers.
Burned\nunits have 0 defense against fire,\nand always act last.\nFrozen\nunits have 0 defense against ice,\nand do not get extra attacks.\nAcid Burn\nunits have 0 defense against poison,\nand their Special Defense falls to 0.
* Units blessed with\nProtection\nare surrounded by a wall of mystic energy, fully\nblocking 1 physical attack.\n* Units covered by an\nOrphic Ward\nare surrounded by a wall of mystic energy, fully\nblocking 1 mystic attack.
* Units with the status\nPhys Eater\nabsorb as HP all physical damage received\nfor a set number of turns.\n* Units with the status\nMystic Eater\nabsorb as HP all mystic damage received\nfor a set number of turns.
Paralyzed\nunions are blocked from using\ncombat arts for a set number of turns.\nSilenced\nunions are blocked from using\nmystic arts for a set number of turns.\nPoisoned\nunions lose a percentage\nof HP after each unit's turn.
Cursed\nunions have the chance of\ninstant death before each unit's action.\nEnthralled\nunions are ensorcelled to mistake\nfriend for foe, and thus attack the wrong side\nuntil the end of battle.
* Unions with\nDecoy\nstatus\nattract all enemy attention\nand attacks.\n* Unions with\nStealth\nstatus\ncannot be caught in Deadlock.
* Unions with\nCharge Up\nstatus\nreceive an additional amount of AP each turn.\n* Unions with\nCharge Down\nstatus\nreceive a reduced amount of AP each turn.

By befriending the mysterious being Mr. Diggs, you\nmay use harvesting points to get components useful\nfor customization. Try taking Mr. Diggs to many\nplaces to see what you can find.

Sometimes, special harvest points appear on the map.\nThese locations are rumored to have\nburied treasure\nThe items found here are especially rare. However,\nyou can only make one attempt to retrieve them.
Unnaturally good at harvesting items, and almost\ndefinitely alive,\nMr. Diggs\ncan become even better\nat harvesting through practice. The more it tries,\nthe more and better quality items it can retrieve.
The number of times Mr. Diggs can harvest is\ndisplayed as the\nDigs Count\nThis number can be increased by possessing certain\nitems. The count is reset on returning to the World Map\nso feel free to harvest freely.
