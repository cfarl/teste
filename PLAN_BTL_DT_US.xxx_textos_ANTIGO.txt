[Remnants 1]
Remnants are mysterious objects
that hold powers beyond those of men.
[Remnants 2]
No one knows when or how Remnants
were created.
[Remnants 3]
Men have used Remnants as
beneficial tools since ancient times.
[Remnants 4]
Towns and kingdoms were built
around Remnants with strong powers.
[Remnants 5]
The Imperial City of Undelwalt was
the first to be built around a Remnant.
[Remnants 6]
A powerful Remnant can affect even
the environment around it.
[Remnants 7]
It is said that a Remnant once caused a flourishing
city in the Great Sand Sea to fall into ruin.
[Remnants 8]
In order to use the powers of a Remnant,
one must bind it to himself.
[Remnants 9]
To bind a Remnant, one simply needs to
place a hand over the Remnant and concentrate.
[Remnants 10]
However, a Remnant can only be bound
during its Luminescence.
[Remnants 11]
Luminescence is a natural occurence
that causes light to emit from a Remnant.
[Remnants 12]
Luminescence occurs in a cycle,
the length differing for each Remnant.
[Remnants 13]
A short cycle can be a few minutes,
while a long cycle can take years.
[Remnants 14]
One known Luminescence cycle is
that of the Remnant Ark: three months.
[Remnants 15]
No one knows why Luminescence
occurs. Perhaps it is a signal.
[Remnants 16]
If a Remnant is bound to someone,
it cannot be bound by anyone else.
[Remnants 17]
A bound Remnant can only be operated
by whom it is bound to.
[Remnants 18]
An unbound Remnant is called
a Blank Remnant.
[Remnants 19]
A Collapse is a misfortune triggered by a
Blank Remnant being unbound for too long.
[Remnants 20]
The most common effect of a Collapse
is the spawning of monsters.
[Remnants 21]
Some forms of Collapse are said
to affect people's minds.
[Remnants 22]
Operating a Remnant wears away
at the operator's soul.
[Remnants 23]
The core Remnants of each town
are bound by the town's Lord.
[Remnants 24]
The Remnant Elysion is currently
unbound.
[Remnants 25]
A lord bound to a core Remnant is said
to have a shorter lifespan than others.
[Remnants 26]
A Remnant's size does not relate to its strength,
though the core Remnants have great powers.
[Remnants 27]
It is inferred that all Remnants were
created from Elysion.
[Remnants 28]
Remnants constantly emit resonating waves.
[Remnants 29]
Remnants are made from an unknown
substance, unaffected by space or time.
[Remnants 30]
An unproven theory suggests that
Remnants are a type of life form.
[The Marshalls 1]
The Marshalls were an ancient clan,
infamous for their mysterious powers.
[The Marshalls 2]
A Marshall did not need a focus
object to use mystic arts.
[The Marshalls 3]
The Marshalls used magick, an ancient
ability that has long been forgotten.
[The Marshalls 4]
The Marshalls were said to have
developed many fantastic techniques.
[The Marshalls 5]
The tablet discovered in Marshallton is one of
the last surviving relics of the Marshalls' skills.
[The Marshalls 6]
The Marshall tablet holds the power to seal
and transform a Remnant into a talisman.
[The Marshalls 7]
While all such transformed Remnants are called
talismans, the exact forms they take on differ.
[The Marshalls 8]
In the form of a talisman, a Remnant
will not trigger a Collapse.
[The Marshalls 9]
A Remnant in talisman form can be used
by anyone. It does not need to be bound.
[The Marshalls 10]
The Marshalls disappeared from history
with the age of the Imperator.

that conducts illegal Remnant experiments.

There are four main races in the world:
mitra, yama, qsiti, and sovani.
[World Races 2]
It is said the sovani ruled over all
of the other races during ancient times.
[World Races 3]
A Marshall has the appearance of a mitra,
but no one truly knows what they are.
[The Fallen 1]
A creature once feared as a wrathful god. Records
of its existence date back hundreds of years.
[The Fallen 2]
Some say it was created by the world itself
as a way to rid itself of Remnants.

I really wanted this!
Great!
Yay! I've got them all!
Oh man...
This is nice.
This is exactly what I needed.
And that's the last of them.
...Perhaps next time.
Hmm.
At last.
Excellent.
Hmph.
Finally, I've found it.
I've been looking for this.
Oho, that's the full set.
*sigh*
Ooh, this's the one!
Ha! Got it!
Yeahhh! Caught 'em all!
Whaaat? No fair!
Oh! I've found it.
Yes...this is what I've needed!
Wonderful! Now I've collected them all.
Ahh... A pity.
If there is no objection, I shall take this.
At last, it is mine.
I was able to gather them all.
Hmph... Fine; I can wait.
There you are.
This is just what I needed.
That should be the last of them.
Hmph, do as you like.
I'll take this!
All according to plan.
And that's everything I needed!
Oh no... How could you...
I'll be takin' that.
Had my eye on this for a while.
Huhhh, looks like a full set.
Keh, what's that all about?
Oh yes...it's as if it were made for me!
With this, I need nothing else.
Marvelous...with this piece, I have finished my collection!
I cannot believe such an affront!
I wanted this! ...I think.
I was looking for this! ...Right?
Then that's all the components I needed! ...Right?
Now that I think of it, maybe I didn't need that after all...
Will you entrust this item to my care?
I have received a good thing.
Good. My preparations are complete.
Regrettable, but I can endure.
Of course I'll be takin' that.
Hell yeah! I got it!
And that's the whole shebang.
Dammit! That was mine!
I understand this is to be mine?
I've hoped to acquire this.
I've gained all the components I need!
Ah... He who hesitates is lost.
You'll let me have this, right?
I got it.
That's the last of them, thank goodness!
I-I didn't get it? Oh...
Hmm, this is nice.
I'd hoped to get this.
And now my components are complete!
Next time, then.
Goodness, is this for me?
Thank you.
Hmm? It seems that's the last component I needed.
*sigh* Well, maybe next time.
I'll be taking this.
Ehh, not too shabby.
Huhhh, looks like a full set.
Gimme a break!
Like, this is mine!
*giggle*
Sweet, I totally got them all!
Oh my god emperor, you totally didn't need that half as much as I did.
Alright, hand it over.
Got it!
Heh, that's the end of 'em.
Somebody's feeling ballsy.
Oh! That's it!
Lucky me!
Yay! I've got them all!
Oh poo.
I'll be takin' my reward, then.
Good, good.
Finally, I've got the last of 'em.
It's orders, so I'll suck it up...
If nobody else needs it, guess I'll take it.
This thing, huh?
Hmph, looks like that's the last of 'em.
I'll remember that...
Mm-hmm!
This is of great importance.
Ahh...I see I've collected all I need.
Hrm...
I'll take this, thanks.
Thank the Emperor I got this.
Good. I shouldn't need any more components now.
...Guess I'll get the next one.
Yoink! You get nothing! Faced!!!
Ohohohohohohoho!
Yeahhh, who got 'em all, who da man?
Whaaat? You cheating-y cheater!
I can take this, right?
Finally.
Ehh, that didn't take TOO long.
Whaddaya mean, I can't have it?
I want this! I mean, if it's okay...
Yay!
Yay, I got all my components!
Oh...fiddlesticks!
I assume this will be mine?
Eureka!
Brilliant. This is the last component I needed.
Hrm...
Hand it over.
Perfect.
That's the last of them.
Hmph.
I may take this?
We must use this the way it was meant to be used.
At last, I can craft better equipment.
It is of little concern to me.
What am I to do with this?
I'll take this if I must.
Hmm. It seems my collection is complete.
I need nothing.
Heheh, finally, something decent.
Yes...yes! YES!!!
Heheh, one more thing to kill with.
Who took it! Tell me so I can wring your neck!
...Taking this.
...That's the last of them.
...New equipment, huh?
...
I'll take that!
Nice!
Hey, now I can upgrade my stuff!
Grr...
Let me have it!
That's all of them, right?
Awesome! Now I can upgrade my stuff!
Wh-what? I wanted that...
Fork over the loot!
Yeah! That's all of 'em!
Awright! Upgrade time!
Oh, gimme a freaking break!
If you'll allow me to take this...
Excellent.
And with this, I may become stronger.
How could this be happening?
...I'll take this.
...That's the full set.
...Upgrade-ready.
Rrgh...
I'll take that!
Heyyy, got another one.
Great, now I can upgrade my equipment.
Ahh...
Dibs!
Got another one!
Yes! Got a full set!
Ehh? That was so mine...
Outta the way, kids.
Ha ha ha ha!
Hah! My gear's gonna be so badass!
Oh, come on.

Another step along the path to true strength.
Unbelievable...

Hey, meanie! C'mon, let's go!
I'm busy now...next time?
Oh... Ah, alright, I understand...
Should I start practicing
ptalk_embed
Or stick with what I've already been learning?
What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Okay! I'll do my best to help everyone out!
Go with what you know.
Okay! I'll work hard and try to learn some
more powerful spells!
You gotta choose for yourself.
I guess so...
Alright, let me think about it a little more.
Should I start practicing
ptalk_embed
Or stick with what I've already been learning?
What do you think, Rush?
Different is good.
Okay! I'll do my best to get strong enough
to help everyone out!
Just polish what you've got.
Okay!
I'll work hard and try to focus what I know.
You gotta choose for yourself.
I guess so...
Alright, let me think about it a little more.
Rush, can we talk? I've been wondering if
I should be focusing my training more...
Being well-rounded is the best.
I see... Yeah, I guess then I'd be able to do
a little of everything, huh?
Focus on combat!
Combat arts, huh?
You just wanna see me as a brawler...
Soon I'll be able to beat you up!
Focus on spells!
Okay! I'll do my best to learn as much as I can.
Rush... What should I focus on for training?
If there's anything I can do to be useful, then...
Hey
anything you want, Sis.
Really? Huh... Okay then, I know what to do.
Thanks, Rush.
Combat, for sure!
Really? Huh... Okay then, I know what to do.

I see...a pity.
Perhaps later there will be an opportunity.
Rush... Could I borrow your
ptalk_embed
Sure, no prob.
Thank you...I appreciate it.
Ehh... I need this for now.
...I see.
Rush, if you're free, let's fight a bit outside
of town. I have to admit I'm feeling a bit rusty...
Aww, I can't say no to you.
Perfect. Then let's head out.
No.
I-I see...
I'll do my best not to falter in the field, then...
Hmm... Learn the new spell
ptalk_embed
Or stick with what I've already been learning?
What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright. Hopefully it will prove a good addition
to our repertoire.
Go with what you know.
Understood. Mastering what I already know
should prove helpful in the future.
You gotta choose for yourself.
I suppose you're right...
Alright, let me think about it a little more.

I suppose you are right...
Alright, let me think about it a little more.
Rush, do you have a moment?
I've been wondering how I should focus my
training, and I'd like your opinion.
Be an all 'rounder.
I see... Certainly, I wouldn't have to worry
about a particular weakness then.
Combat arts, for sure!
Ahh, I thought you'd say that.
There is something to be said for brains over
brawn...nothing wrong with brawn, though.
Definitely mystic arts!
Mmm, you have a point, mastering mystic arts
is a powerful and useful skill.
Rush... What should I focus on for training?
To be a good leader, I need to know as
much as I can.
Do it all
flexibility is good!
Ahh...I see.
Thank you...I can walk my path clearly with this.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Ahh...I see.
Thank you...I can walk my path clearly with this.
Mystic arts suit you 100%.

ptalk_embed

Yeah, let's go.
It's appreciated.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Hello, Rush. Not to be blunt, but I'd like your
ptalk_embed
Would you lend it to me?
Sure, no prob.
Appreciated. It'll be used hard, but used well.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...Is that so.
Say, Rush, you look unoccupied.
How about we pick up some battles, hmm?
Just a little something to work the kinks out.
Sounds like a plan.
Oho? You surprised me.
I didn't think you'd be up for any fun.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Tsk, figured as much.
All play and no work...
Hmm... The spell
ptalk_embed
...
Is it worth the time to learn it? Or ought I just stick with
what I already know?
Don't run from a challenge!
A challenge, hmm? Fine, I'll give it a shot.
Go with what you know.
Good point.
Then I'll focus on the spells I already have.
You've gotta decide that.
Hm! I suppose you have a point there.
No point in living if you can't trust in yourself.
Hmm... Learn the new technique
ptalk_embed
Or stick with what I already know?
What do you think, Rush?
Different is good.
A challenge, hmm? Fine, I'll give it a shot.
New tricks? Not for old dogs!
Funny. My old tricks are more than enough
to keep you from any more lippy remarks.
You gotta choose for yourself.
Hm! I suppose you have a point there.
No point in living if you can't trust in yourself.
Rush, do you have a moment? I can't quite
decide how I should focus my training.
All-rounder, natch.
Hmm... I do like the idea of not being poor at
anything in particular.
Combat arts, for sure!
Ahh...
For what is a knight without a skill for combat?
Definitely mystic arts!
Ahh... Mystic arts are useful skills.
Rush... What should I focus on for training?
I thought I'd decided, but I'm less certain than
I thought...
Balance is the key.
Heh... I think this talk was just what I needed.
I won't be wasting time worrying about this again.
Combat arts suit you 110%.
Heh... I think this talk was just what I needed.
I won't be wasting time worrying about this again.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Heh... I think this talk was just what I needed.
I won't be wasting time worrying about this again.
Rush, you ever heard of
ptalk_embed
I was hoping you'd come with me to look for some.
Alrighty!
It's appreciated.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see...
Creep.
Say, Rush, think you could lend me your
ptalk_embed
for a bit?
Sure, no prob.
Really?
I appreciate it.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...Snitty comments like that aren't going to win
you any points with your sister.
Say, Rush. I'm getting antsy...
What say we pick up some battles, hmm?
Sounds like a plan.
That's what I like to hear. C'mon!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Ah, too bad.
Hey, Rush. I've been thinking about learning
ptalk_embed
...
What do you think?
Go for it!
You think? I don't know how useful it'll be,
but you never know until you try, right?
Nah, focus on what you've got.
Good point. Then I'll try and polish up what I
know so I can learn more powerful spells.
You gotta choose for yourself.
You've got a point... Kinda stings coming
from a kid like you, though!

You gotta choose for yourself.
You've got a point... Kinda stings to hear it
from someone younger than me, though!
Rush, how do you think I should focus my
training? I've been feeling a little uncertain
about it...
A little of everything's good.
Hmm... Maybe you have a point.
Combat arts, for sure!
Ahh... Combat is important.
Definitely mystic arts!
Ahh... Mystic arts are useful skills.
What do you think I should focus on for

Whoa, that
ptalk_embed

Sure, no prob.
For real? Appreciate it, man.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Boo to that.
Heya, Rush! I bet you're bored like me...
How 'bout we go do some fighting, show
some monsters who's boss, eh?
Sounds like a plan.
Yeahh, that's more like it! C'mon!
Sorry... Maybe next time.
Aw, why you gotta be so cold?
So I was thinking of learning
ptalk_embed
...
Whadda you think, Rush?
Go for it!
Alright.
It'll definitely be a challenge, but that's not
gonna stop me!
Nah, focus on what you've got.
Okay! I'll keep trainin' what I got and learn
some real kickass spells!
That decision's all up to you.
Ouch...that's harsh, man.

Rush, whaddya think about me focusing my
training? It's enough for me to just trust in
my strength and my equipment, right?
You should go for balance.
Huh, that sounds good.
Then I could do anything!
Combat arts, for sure!
Oh yeah. That's definitely my style, huh?
Definitely mystic arts!
You think so? Well, I'll do my best.
Hey, Rush, what do you think I should focus
my training on? I'm worried I'm holding
the others back...
Do it all
flexibility is good!
Yeah... It suits me, too, I think.
Awright, no more of this wishy-washy bull.
Let's go, Rush!
Combat arts suit you 110%.

Rush, my boy, I've found myself in need of
ptalk_embed
Have we the time to obtain one?
Sure.
Excellent! Then let's get a move on.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Rush, would you lend me your
ptalk_embed
for a while?
Sure, no prob.
So generous! I appreciate it.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
I never imagined you so petty...
Oh, Rush. If you've some free time, why
don't we fight a bit outside of town?
Sitting around all day isn't good for you...
Yeah, let's hit it!
As I expected from you! Let's be off!
Kinda busy, sorry.
Hum... Slack on your training and you'll find
your body rebelling when you really need it.
Hmm... Learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue polishing what I know?
I'm curious, Rush, what do you think?
Try something new!
Hmm! I always have loved learning.
Focus on what you know.
Jack-of-all-trades, master of none, as they
say...
Then I'll work on mastering the areas I do know.
That decision's all up to you.
I tip my hat to you... It's just as you say.
Hmm... Learn

Then I'll work on mastering the areas I currently
know.
That decision's all up to you.
I tip my hat to you... It's just as you say.
Rush, what do you think I should focus on?
Is it really enough to maximize my command
of mystic arts?
Learn a little bit of everything.
I see...
I suppose that would avoid being too one-sided.
Combat arts, for sure!
I see... Combat arts are quite dependable.
Definitely mystic arts!
Exactly! Goodness, look at me, doing all this
worrying over nothing...
Rush, what do you think I should focus on?
I fear I'm not able to help the others as I should...
Go for balance.
Thank you, Rush.
You've helped me make a decision.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush.
You've helped me make a decision.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush.

Excellent.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see.
Would you allow me to borrow your
ptalk_embed
Sure, no prob.
Thank you.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
Do we have time to engage some monsters?
It would not do to slack on training.
Sounds like a plan.
Mm. Let's go.
Kinda busy, sorry.
You'll never become stronger with that attitude.
To learn
ptalk_embed
...
I've found I cannot decide whether it's worth taking
energy from my current disciplines.
Go for it!
Heh. Of course.
Focus on what you've got!
Then I shall concentrate on higher-level
spells in the areas I already study.
You should choose, not me.
Oho... You're full of surprises.

You should decide.
Oho... You're full of surprises.
Am I properly focusing my training? In times
like this, my lack of discipline could be the
difference between success and failure for Athlum...
You should go for balance.
Certainly that is the best path for a sovani...
Combat arts, for sure!
Becoming a specialist in man-to-man combat,
then? Certainly not a bad thing...
Definitely mystic arts!
Focusing the spirit... I admit, this is my personal
preference.
I wonder... Is there a way I can focus my training to
be more effective? There must be a way to be more
helpful to Lord David...
Balance is the key.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.
I'll go forward...for Athlum.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.
I'll go forward...for Athlum.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.
I'll go forward...for Athlum.
There's something I need, young one
ptalk_embed
Come with me to find it.
Okay, sure.
Good. Let's head out.
Sorry...maybe later.
Harumph.
Young one, your
ptalk_embed
...
I'd like to put it to good use...
It's all yours.
Appreciated.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Harumph.
You look free, young one.
Instead of wasting time here, we should hit
the battlefield!
Sounds like a plan.
Then, follow me.
Kinda busy, sorry.
And you wonder why you're so weak.
Hmm... Learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue polishing what I know?
What's the wiser choice?
Don't run from a challenge!
A challenge, hmm? Fine, I'll give it a shot.
Go with what you know.
Hum. As I'd decided from the start.
After a bit more practice, I'll show you some
truly amazing spells.
You gotta choose for yourself.
You don't know either, do you...
Hmm... Learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue polishing what I know?
What's the wiser choice?
Don't run from a challenge!
A challenge, hmm? Fine, I'll give it a shot.
Go with what you know.
Hum. As I'd decided from the start.
After a bit more practice, I'll show you some
truly amazing moves.
You should choose, not me.
You don't know either, do you...
What should I focus on from now on?
I'm not worried or anything, just curious...
Do it all!
That is an option...
Combat arts, for sure!
Mm... I, too, was thinking I would need to
become even stronger...
Definitely mystic arts!
Mmm... Mystic arts aren't anything to laugh at,
either, I suppose...
So... Where should I go from here?
I can only go forward, but in what direction?
Balance is the key.
Mmm... I see.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Mmm... I see.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Mmm... I see.
ptalk_embed
...
That's what I need. Do you think we'd
have time to pick one up?
Sure, no prob.
Really? Great!
Let's get going!
Sorry...maybe later.
Oh? That's too bad.
Say, Rush, could I have a look at your
ptalk_embed
for a little while? I'd like to conduct some testing...
Sure, no prob.
Are you sure? Thanks!
Ehh... I need it right now.
Ahh...
Rush, do you think we'd have some time to go
battle some? I think I'm on the verge of a
new discovery!
Sounds like a plan.
Great! Then let's go.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Ah, I see.
Maybe next time.
Should I start
ptalk_embed
Or stick with what I've already been learning?
What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
You think so? Alright. I'll do my best!
Go with what you know.
Ahh, I see.
Alright, I'll concentrate on the areas I
already study for now.
You should choose, not me.
I see... Let me give it some more thought.
Should I learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue to practice what I already know?
What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright!
This should be an interesting experiment...
Just polish what you've got.
Alright. I'll focus on the areas I know...
I'm sure there's a lot more knowledge to
be gleaned.
You should decide.
You have a point...
Let me put a little more thought into it.
Rush, what do you think I should be focusing
on? I've been a little worried, lately...
Being well-rounded is good!
Yes... If you can do a little of everything,
travel isn't much of an obstacle...
Combat arts, for sure!
When things get tough, that sort of strength
can be useful, I guess.
Definitely mystic arts!
Sounds helpful to Remnant research!
Say, Rush, what areas do you think I should
focus on? I'm curious to hear your opinion.
Do it all
flexibility is good!
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into
consideration and do my best!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into
consideration and do my best!
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into
consideration and do my best!
What's good? I'm thinking we should get some
ptalk_embed
It'll be the jump-off.
Alrighty!
Word. Then let's roll.
Sorry, man, maybe later.
You're wyling.
Oh, so that
ptalk_embed
you got? You're gonna let me borrow it, right?
Sure, no prob.
Props, man. That's chill.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Punk.
You trying to get your battle on or something?
I like kicking ass, not sitting on it.
Yeah, I'm game.
Cool. Let's bounce then.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Pathetic.
So I guess I could learn
ptalk_embed
but it kinda sounds like a waste of time...
No way
go for it!
Alright. Then I'll try to get it down ASAP.
Yeah, I'd give it a pass.
Alright. Polishing what I already know ain't
gonna hurt anything.
I dunno... What do you think?
I think I asked you for your opinion...
Whatever.
Was thinking of learning
ptalk_embed
...
Whadda you think?
Yeah, I'd go for it!
Alright. With some more arts under my belt
I'd be sick on the battlefield.
Nah, work on what you've got.
What, you think I'm fallin' off?
...Nah, I hear you. I need to lock down the
arts I already know.
Whatever you want.
Wow. How unhelpful.
What should I focus on from now on...
Eh? Just talking to myself, never mind.
All-rounder, natch.
Sounds quick and easy.
Combat arts, for sure!
Yeahhh...that sounds about right.
Definitely mystic arts!
Huh... Maybe.
Sup, Rush. I was just thinking about what
sort of training I should focus on...
Not that you gotta worry about that.
Balance is the key.
Mmm...
Sorry for underestimating you all this time.
From now on it's on!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Mmm...
Sorry for underestimating you all this time.
From now on it's on!
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Mmm...
Sorry for underestimating you all this time.
From now on it's on!
Rush, I need a favor... I am looking for the
ptalk_embed
I thought together we could find it, perhaps in the blink
of an eye.
Alrighty!
Really? You are a lifesaver.
Sorry...maybe later.
How unfortunate...
Your
ptalk_embed
is impressive... Yet it would be even more so in my
possession. What do you think?
...Sure, you can borrow it.
You have my eternal gratitude.
It shall be used spectacularly.
No, I need to hold onto it.
So cold... Believe me when I say that the ladies
prefer a man who is warm...if not blazing hot.
Rush... Shall we proceed to the field of battle
and wreak havoc upon the monster hordes?
I...must become someone she can depend on...
Sounds like a plan.
Excellent!
My arm sings with the promise of victory!
Busy now, sorry.
Do you truly think you will attract a lover
with an attitude like that?
I have the chance to add
ptalk_embed
to my repertoire... Should I?
Go for it!
I don't want to be known as a man afraid of
commitment... Yet I shall attempt this new
type of skill.
Nah, I'd give it a pass.
I see. Then I shall focus on what I already know.
Soon the most beautiful spells you have ever
seen shall be mine to command!
Whatever you want, dude.
You...you think I'm unreliable, don't you...
ptalk_embed
...
Should I begin to study it? Or focus on what I
already know?
Try something new!
A true man isn't tempted by every new face that
crosses his path... And yet there is something to
be said for...fresh experiences.
Just polish what you've got.
I see. Then I shall focus on what I already know.
Soon the most beautiful techniques you have ever
seen shall be mine to command!
Decide that for yourself.
I see... The answer lies within me, waiting for Fate
herself to pluck it from my tender breast...
I shall give her the time she needs.
What should I focus my training on? Alas, it is
too much for me to even select a single maid
to lay my affections on...
Being well-rounded is good!
I see... The best of both worlds, as it were.
Combat arts, for sure!
Combat, hm?
I suppose I am a bit of a swashbuckler.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells, hm?
I must admit, I am not poor at the mystic arts.
Rush Sykes! I know you see me as unreliable...
Thus, I ask you
what should I focus my training on?
All 'rounder is the way to go.
Ahh... Yes, you are right.
And now it is time I did what I must do.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Ahh... Yes, you are right.
And now it is time I did what I must do.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Ahh... Yes, you are right.
And now it is time I did what I must do.
Do you have a moment? Have you heard of
ptalk_embed
I think I need one. Shall we search?
Sure, let's go.
Oho. You're a big help.
Sorry...maybe later.
Alright. I'm in no hurry.
What is that...
ptalk_embed
...
Would you lend it to me for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Are you certain? I thank you.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
I feel like I'm getting dull and flabby...
Shall we fight some monsters for a bit?
Sounds like a plan.
I see you are also a fan of combat.
Kinda busy, sorry.
Ahh... You looked free... My mistake.
Hmm... Learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue polishing what I know?
What's the wiser choice?
Try something new!
Yes...
Perhaps I could remember something I've lost...
Focus on what you've got!
Ahh... So, I should focus my training on becoming
more proficient in the areas I know.
You should decide.
Ah...I see.

What path should I follow from now on? I don't
even remember the one I took to get to this point...
All-rounder, natch.
Ahh... With that, no need to worry.
Combat arts, for sure!
My body should remember that...I hope.
Mystic arts, for sure.
My body should remember that...I hope.
What do you think I should focus on from
now on?
I value your opinion.
Do it all
flexibility is good!
Yes...yes.
I will keep this in mind as I go forward.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Yes...yes.
I will keep this in mind as I go forward.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Yes...yes.

Master Sykes, might I trouble you for a moment?
I seek a
ptalk_embed
and hoped that you might assist me in obtaining one.
Sure, let's go.
As always, I appreciate your help.
Sorry...maybe later.
Understood... A pity.
Master Sykes, might you be willing to lend me your
ptalk_embed
No prob!
Ohh!
As always, I appreciate your generosity.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
I never thought
Ah, nothing. Forget I said anything.
Master Sykes, would you accompany me to
the nearest battlefield? Even at this age,
it is poor form to shirk one's training.
Yeah, let's go!
I appreciate your indulgence.
Let us go at once.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Shall I attempt to learn
ptalk_embed
or focus on areas I already know? At this age,
it's no small matter to make a decision either way...
Try something new!
You are right...
I am far too old for pusillanimity!
Stick to what you know.
Understood. I shall focus my training on
proceeding further down the paths of
the mystic arts I already know.
You should decide.
Touché. Forgive my show of weakness...
You are truly wise beyond your years.

Touché. Forgive my show of weakness...
You are truly wise beyond your years.
How should I focus my training from now on?
I've found myself plagued with uncertainties
of late, thus I'd value your opinion, Master Sykes.
All-rounder, natch.
There is truth to your words...
A knight must be able to perform any task.
Combat arts, for sure!
A knight without a proper command of
combat arts is but a disgrace.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells can be useful tools in saving lives.
Master Sykes, do you think there's a better way I
could be focusing my training? Even at this age,
I sometimes wonder...
Balance is the key.
I am prepared.
As a knight of the Order of Melphina, I will
act proudly and without shame.
Combat arts is the way to go.

Hey, I need some

If you got time to sit around and talk, you've
got time to go get some eh?
Yeah, let's go.
Arright. C'mon.
Sorry...maybe later.
Ah. Don't wanna be seen with me, eh?
Don't blame you.
So, how about your
ptalk_embed
Why don'tcha let me take care of it for a while?
Sure, no prob.
F'r real? You're alright.
I kinda need it right now.
And this is why I hate people.
All this sitting around is making me nervous...
What say we pick up some battles, hmm?
Sounds like a plan.
Good. Let's go.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
*snort*
Guess I could learn
ptalk_embed
but it sounds like a waste of time...
No way
go for it!
Huh. Guess I'll see if it's useful after all.
Yeah, I'd give it a pass.
Polish up what I already got, eh?
You should decide.
...Right. Forget I asked.
Was thinking of learning
ptalk_embed
...
Whadda you think?
Yeah, I'd go for it!
Alright. I'll give it a go.
Nah, work on what you've got.

You should decide.
...Right. Forget I asked.
Hey. You think I'm trainin' in the right things?
...Ridiculous, ain't it? A bandit worrying about
this type of stuff...
Being well-rounded is good!
Yeah?
Guess there ain't no weakness in that.
Combat arts, for sure!
Yeah?
Guess I'm pretty used to hefting weapons
around.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Yeah... I saw the usefulness of mystic arts
firsthand when I was actively banditing.
So, whadda you think I should be training in?
Wanna know what you think.
Do it all
flexibility is good!
Okay. For Reya... And, for friends...
I'll give it a shot.

Rush, I have need of a
ptalk_embed
Have we the time to obtain one?
Yeah, let's go.
You have my gratitude. Let us be off.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Rush, might you lend me your
ptalk_embed
I promise to put it to good use.
Sure, no prob.
Are you certain? I appreciate your generosity.
I kinda need it right now.
Ahh...I see.
Rush, have we time to do some fighting at
the nearest battlefield? I still must prove to
my father that I can be a competent knight...
Alright, sure.
You have my gratitude. Let us be off.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Ought I learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue my current studies? What do you think, Rush?
Sure! Try something new.
Alright.
I shall do my best to master this new field.
Stick to what you know.
As you say.
I shall further refine those spells I do know.
Decide that for yourself.
As you say...
If Father were to hear of my indecisiveness,
he would be much displeased...

think I'm following the right path in my
training? Where should I have my focus?
You should go for balance.
Certainly, attempting everything leaves no
deficiency.
Combat arts, for sure!
Focus on the art of combat, ah? Certainly,
that is necessary for a future ruler...
Mystic arts, for sure.
I see.
Certainly it is important to master the mystic arts.
Spells, combat arts, or a mix of the two...
What ought to be my main focus? It is not
an easy decision.
Balance is the key.
Thank you. From now on I shall work hard to
earn the trust of the people of Royotia.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Thank you. From now on I shall work hard to

Rush, you know
ptalk_embed
right? Well, I was hoping maybe we could go find
some if it wasn't too much trouble...
Yeah, let's go.
Really? Thank you so much.
Let's go, alright?
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Maybe some other time.
Um, Rush...
Your
ptalk_embed
...
Do you think I could use it for a bit?
No prob!
It's really okay?
Thank you so much...
I kinda need it right now.
Oh...
Rush, do you think we might be able to
battle some monsters for a bit? I don't
want to get too rusty...
Sounds good to me.
Thank you.
Then, shall we be off?
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Ah, I see.
Well, maybe next time...
Should I learn
ptalk_embed
Or just continue my studies? What do you think, Rush?
Go for it!
You think so? Okay...I'll do my best.
Focus on what you've got!
Ahh...that makes sense. I'll try to refine
the spells I know to be more powerful.
Decide that for yourself.
Ah... You're right. If I can't even decide
this for myself, how can I help Kate...

You should decide.
Ah... You're right. If I can't even decide
this for myself, how can I help Kate...
Rush, do you have a moment? I can't
decide how I should focus my training...
All-rounder, natch.
Makes sense...
I wouldn't have to choose either way, would I?
Combat arts, for sure!
Combat, huh? I'd better start working out...
Mystic arts, for sure.
Oh? I guess I'm not that bad at them.
Rush, how should I focus my training
from now on? Kate won't help me at all...
Balance is the key.
I understand.
I can't live under the wings of others forever, right?

ptalk_embed
I'd like to put it to use...
Sure, no prob.
Are you certain? I thank you.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.

Rush, do we have time to do some fighting?
I don't want to get rusty.
Sure, no prob.
Thank you.
Then, shall we be off?
Sorry... Maybe next time.
It's alright. Sorry for troubling you.
Start studying
ptalk_embed
Or stick to areas I know? Hmm...
Try something new!
As you say. It should be helpful knowledge.
Focus on what you've got!
Understood. I'll focus on making my mystic arts
as strong as possible.
You should decide.
Forgive me. It's just as you say.
Should I learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue to practice what I already know?
What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright.
I shall do my best to master this new field.
Just polish what you've got.
Alright.
I'll further refine those techniques I do know.
You should decide.
Forgive me. It's just as you say.
Rush, how should I further my training?
I'd appreciate your advice...
You should go for balance.
I see... Then I shall attempt it.
Combat arts, for sure!
Combat, ah? I see.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells, ah? I see.
What do you think I should focus on from
now on?

Sure, let's go.
Excellent. Then, let's not waste any time.
Sorry...maybe later.
Well! I never.
I was just thinking that your
ptalk_embed
looked so striking... Might I borrow it for a bit?
Sure, no prob.
I appreciate it.
Ehh... I need it right now.
Well! I never.
Rush, if you have some free time, why don't we
engage in a battle or two? I admit, I'm not fond
of being inactive for too long.
Sounds like a plan.
Excellent. Then, let's not waste any time.
Sorry... Maybe next time.
To refuse a lady...!
Hmm... Shall I learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue with my current studies?
Which is the wiser choice?
Try something new!
If you say so. I'll do my best to make it
worthwhile.
Stick with what you know.
If that's what you truly think, then I'll
concentrate on what I do know for now.
You should decide.
Truly, it's as you say...
I will have to give this some more thought.

better myself? Recently I've been worried
about my progress...
Do it all!
Not having a particular weakness
does sound like a good choice.
Combat arts, for sure!
Ahh...
Then I shall work hard to perfect my combat arts.
Mystic arts, for sure.

Yeah, let's go.
I owe you one.
Sorry...maybe later.
Riiight. Whatever.
Tell me about your
ptalk_embed
More specifically, tell me you're gonna hand it over.
No prob!
You serious?
No tradebacks, got it?
Ehh... I kinda need it.
Rrgh... Don't think I'm gonna forget this.
Hey, hey, time's a wasting!
Monsters to fight, loot to collect, eh?
Let's get going!
Sounds good!
That's more like it, kid!
Sorry... Maybe next time.
Seriously?
ptalk_embed
...
Think that stuff's worth looking into?
Sure! Try something new.
Okay.
Dunno if it'll be worth anything, but I'll give
it a shot.
Stick with what you know.
Huh, so polish up what I already got...
Nothing to lose there.
You should decide.
I decided I wanted to ask you...

Fighting, huh? Can't say I don't like it.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells, huh? Eh, wouldn't quite say I hated 'em...
Hey, Rush. What sort of training should I
focus on?
Wanted to get an outside opinion.
Balance is the key.
Alright, I'll trust you on this one.
Even if it's a bust, at least it's free.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Alright, I'll trust you on this one.
Even if it's a bust, at least it's free.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Alright, I'll trust you on this one.
Even if it's a bust, at least it's free.
Oh, so like,
ptalk_embed
I totally need some? So, like, let's go on a harvesting
journey!
Like, totally for sure!
Sweet! This is totally not uncool of you.
Like, no.
That sucks!
So, like, your
ptalk_embed
...
You should totally give it to me.
Okay...
Wow. You're so attentive to my needs.
Do you like me or something?
Ha ha ha. No.
Ugh. Cheapass.
Who likes loot? I do!
So, let's go to the battlefield and get some!
Sounds like a plan.
Like, thanks!
Sorry...maybe later.
Refused? Fail.
ptalk_embed
...
I bet you don't even know this type of mystic arts?
but, like, I'm thinking I should learn it.
Yeah! You go, girl.
Like, here's a tip?
Never say that again.
Work on your current spells.
Really? ...Okay, fine.
I'll just totally max out my spell power then.
If that's what you want.
Wow. Being passive-aggressive?
Sooo last year.
So, I was wondering if I should learn
ptalk_embed
...
I mean, there's other stuff I could be doing...
Go for it!
Okay...
Hopefully this won't be a complete waste of time.
Stick with what you know.
Really? ...Okay, fine.
I'll just totally max out my spell power then.
Only you can decide that.
You sound just like an old woman!
I'd say it was adorable, except that it's not.
Geez, did you know it like takes a lot of work to
become a witch, or whatever?
What should I train in the meantime?
Do it all!
An awesome witch like me had better know
some of everything, right?
Combat arts, for sure!
Like, seriously? You do know that witch
equals mystic stuff, right?
Mystic arts, for sure.
Amirite? Like, cutie witch Khrynia is def
down with the mystic arts.
Okay, Rush
what do you think I should focus
my training on? I know, it's hard to believe,
but I want your opinion.
Balance is the key.
Okay. This's like the first step for those of us
who're gonna control the world.
Combat arts is the way to go.

Hey. If you've got time to be standing around, why don't
we go get me some
ptalk_embed
Alrighty!
Appreciate it.
C'mon, let's go.
Sorry...maybe later.
Thanks for nothing, punk.
So, you gonna let me borrow your
ptalk_embed
or what?
Okay.
Seriously? You aren't half bad.
What.
Ha ha, what a comedian. Asshat.
Hey, how 'bout we go fight some monsters, eh?
Unlike Rhagoh, I actually like kicking ass.
Sounds good to me.
Awright!
Let's hit it!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Tsk... Whatever.
You think it's worth it to try learning
ptalk_embed
What would you do?
Try something new!
Alright, I'll give it a shot.
Spells aren't my strong suit though.
Stick with what you know!
Makes sense. I'll try and polish up what
I do know to learn more powerful spells.
Decide that for yourself.
You're right. Geez, I sound like Rhagoh.
You think it's worth it to try learning
ptalk_embed
What would you do?
Go for it!
Alright.
Just know it's not my thing.
Stick with what you know.
Makes sense. I'll try and polish up what
I do know to learn more powerful skills.
Decide that for yourself.
You're right. Geez, I sound like Rhagoh.
Rush. So, if you were me, what sort of training would
you focus on? I hate to admit it, but I can't decide.
All-rounder, natch.
Makes sense...
Don't have to choose just one, eh?
Combat arts, for sure!
Figured you'd say that.
It is my specialty, after all.
Definitely mystic arts!
Eh? That's more Rhagoh's bag, but eh,
I'll give it a shot.
What sort of training do you think I should focus on?
Go for balance.
Alright, sounds good. Should be able to make
up for Rhagoh's slacking, at least.
You're a natural-born fighter.
Alright, sounds good.
Should be able to make up for Rhagoh's slacking,
at least.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Alright, sounds good.
Should be able to make up for Rhagoh's slacking,

Rush, do you know
ptalk_embed
I think I really need one! Do you think we'd have
time to pick one up?
Yeah, let's go.
Thank you!
Okey-dokey, let's go!
Sorry...maybe later.
Awww, really?
Say, Rush, can I see your
ptalk_embed
Like, for keeps? Or at least for borrows?
Sure, no prob.
Yay! Thank you!
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Oh...
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
How about we go fight some monsters
or something?
Sounds like a plan.
Great! So, come on!
Sorry... Maybe next time.
Awww, really?
Should I start practicing
ptalk_embed
Or stick with what I've already been learning?
What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Okay! I'll do my best!
Stick with what you know.
Okey-dokey! I'll keep training so I can learn
some super-powerful spells, okay?
You should decide.
Lady Marsha tells me that all the time...
Should I start practicing
ptalk_embed

Okay! I'll do my best!
Just polish what you've got.
Okey-dokey! I'll keep training so I can learn
some super-powerful spells, okay?
You should decide.
Lady Marsha tells me that all the time...
Hmm....what I should focus on for my training?
I thought maybe being the Cosmos Maiden would
help me decide, but no dice...
All-rounder, natch.
Thank you!
I'm not gonna worry
just work hard!
Combat arts, for sure!
F-fighting, huh?
Sounds hard... But I'll do my best!
Definitely mystic arts!
Mmm...
The Cosmos Maiden can't not do mystic arts, right?
I'm a little worried about my training, and I
don't know who else to ask...
Balance is the key.
Okay!
As the Cosmos Maiden, I'm going to give it my all!
Combat arts is the way to go.

Heya boyo. Reckon we might have the time
to look for some
ptalk_embed
Sure, let's go.
You're a big help.
Let's be off, then.
Sorry, maybe later.
I see...
Maybe next time, then.
So, you might have noticed me eyeing your
ptalk_embed
...
Would you mind lendin' it to me for a bit?
Sure, no prob.
Thank ye kindly.
Don't see many kind souls like you anymore!
Ehh... I need it right now.
...
Rush, if you've got a moment, let's fight a bit outside
of town, shall we? Trainin's the most important part
of being a mercenary, ya know!
Sounds like a plan.
That's what I like to hear.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Hrn...
So I was thinking of learning
ptalk_embed
...
Think that's a good idea?
Yeah, go for it!
Alright, then. The more you know, eh?
Work on your current spells.
Alright, then. I'm sure the mystic arts I know
could do with a polish, eh?
You should decide.
Ahh... Yea, my sis would be disappointed to
hear me giving this sort o' wishy-washy talk.
Should I learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue to practice what I already know?
What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright, then. The more you know, eh?
Just polish what you've got.
Alright, then. I'm sure the arts I know could
do with a polish, eh?
Decide that for yourself.
Ahh... Yea, my sis would be disappointed to
hear me giving this sort o' wishy-washy talk.
What sorts of things should I be focusing my
training on? I've been kinda uncertain lately...
All-rounder, natch.
Fair enough. Then, time to get started!
Combat arts, for sure!
Fair enough. Then, time to get started!
Definitely mystic arts!
Fair enough. Then, time to get started!
Rush, how do you think I should focus my training?
I'd appreciate your advice...
Balance is the key.
Right. Can't believe I've been wastin' all this
time... Alright, I'm gonna redouble my training,
for my sister's sake.
Combat arts is the way to go.

Hey, greenhorn. You ever heard of
ptalk_embed
I bet you would if you came with me to find some.
Okay, sure.
Then come on.
Sorry...maybe later.
Seriously? You're turning me down?
Tell me about your
ptalk_embed
More specifically, tell me you're gonna hand it over.
Sure, no prob.
Then, I'll be taking that!
I kinda need it right now.
*snort*
Hey, greenhorn.
How 'bout we hit the battlefields?
You could use the training, eh?
Yeah, yeah. Let's go!
Follow me!
Whatever dude, later, maybe.
Whaaat?
I don't give invitations to just anybody.
Start studying
ptalk_embed
Or stick to areas I know? Hmm...
Try something new!
I doubt anyone needs to get any more powerful
than I already am, but sure, I'll give it a shot.
Focus on what you've got!
The thought of me having even more powerful spells at
my disposal is pretty ominous, innit? But yeah,
I'll keep at it.
You should decide.
I can't believe I'm getting this from you.

But yeah, I'll keep at it.
Decide that for yourself.
I can't believe I'm getting this from you.
Okay, pop quiz, hotshot.
You're an incredible mercenary.
What do you focus on?
Do it all!
Makes sense, don't it?
I mean, I can already do everything, after all.
Combat arts, for sure!
I know, right?
Of course, I've already mastered pretty much
all there is to know about combat.
Definitely mystic arts!
I know, right?
Of course, I've already mastered pretty much
all there is to know about spellcasting.
Alright, kid, what do you think?
Should I focus my training on something new?
Or am I already too godlike already?
Balance is the key.
Awright. It'll take some training, but that's
what you gotta do if you wanna be known
as the king!
Combat arts is the way to go.

I think I need one. Shall we search?
Yeah, let's go.
Good, good.
Then let's get cracking.
Sorry...maybe later.
A pity, that...
Your
ptalk_embed
...
Would you mind lending it to me for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Ahh... What a gracious child.
Ehh... I need it right now.
Tsk...
Rush, dear boy, shall we fight a bit?
Once you get to be my age, if you keep still
for too long, you can't get moving again...
Sounds like a plan.
Excellent. Let's be off, then.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Harumph...
What happened to respecting one's elders?
Hmm...
ptalk_embed
sounds interesting enough, hmm? But learning new arts
is a challenge when you're my age...
Try something new!
Ho ho ho...
Alright. Let's see what these old bones can do.
Focus on what you've got!
Understood. I'll focus on getting the most out
of what I already know.
Decide that for yourself.
Ha ha ha...
From the mouths of babes...
Hmm...
ptalk_embed
sounds interesting enough, hmm? But learning new arts
is a challenge when you're my age...
You can do it!
Really!
Then, let's see if this old dog can learn
a new trick.
Stick with what you know.
Understood.
I'll focus on polishing my combat arts.
Decide that for yourself.
Ha ha ha...
From the mouths of babes...
What sorts of focus should I have to my training?
I don't want to hold you kids back...
All-rounder, natch.
I may be a decrepit old fighter, but I'll do
my best.
Combat arts, for sure!
With the proper techniques, even the weakest
of men can hold their own in a fight.
Definitely mystic arts!
Mystic arts can help friends out of tight spots,
hmm.
Rush, dear boy, old as I am I feel strange to ask
you, but what sort of training do you think I should
pursue from now on?
Go for balance.
Excellent.
Just watch, son
this old man's in it 'til
the end!
Combat arts is the way to go.

Rush, I really need a
ptalk_embed
Think we could go find one?
Sure, no prob.
Let's get going, then.
Sorry...maybe later.
Ah, I see.
Hey, would you let me borrow your
ptalk_embed
for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Seriously? Thanks.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
Rush, think we could hit the battlefields
for a bit? I want to work on some spells.
Sounds like a plan.
Appreciate it. Come on!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
...
Wonder if I should look into
ptalk_embed
...
Try something new!
Alright. I'm always up for a challenge!
Focus on what you've got!
Yes... I'll continue my training so that I can
learn even more powerful spells.
You should decide.
Seems that way...
Let me think on it some more.

I wanna be helpful and all, you know?
Try a little of everything.
I guess... Best of both worlds, huh?
Combat arts, for sure!
C-combat arts, huh...
I totally blew at that before, but I guess I can
give it a try...
Definitely mystic arts!
Yeah, that makes sense... I've trained all this
time to be a spellcrafter, after all.
Hey, Rush
do you think I'm doing okay,
helping everyone out? If you think there's
a way I can be more useful...
Balance is the key.
Right...
And if I work hard, I know I can make it happen.

Hey! You know what would be super-special awesome?
ptalk_embed
Let's find some!
Yeah, let's go.
Awesome-possum! So let's saddle up!
Sorry, dude.
Guess somebody's got their ticket for the failboat.
Your
ptalk_embed
You must give me it!
O-kay...
Really? Really!? Sweeto!
Uhh...no.
Ooh, aren't we Mr. Grabby-hands, keeping all
the loot for himself... Well, poo on your shoe
and crap in your lap!
Heya, Rush!
Don'tcha think it's time for a little of that
ultra-violence? Let's go fight monsters!
Sounds like a plan.
Awright! It's clobberin' time!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Whaaat?  You're busy? Too busy for me!?
...Why is everyone always too busy for me...
Hey Rush... Should I learn this new type of arts,
ptalk_embed
I mean, what if I'm bad at it
er, I mean, it sucks?
Try something new!
Yeah? I guess I am a natural.
Great idea!
Focus on what you've got!
Yeah? Okay! I'll work on what I've got until
I'm the mystic arts master!
You should decide.
Urg... I'm not good at being the decider...
So it'd be pretty awesome to learn
ptalk_embed
, huh...
But maybe I should stick with what I've got for now...
Try something new!
I know, right?
More arts equals more awesome!
Just polish what you've got.
I know, right? I'll polish what I know until
they're the shining star I am! ...Or whatever.
Decide that for yourself.
Geh... I asked you because I don't like
making decisions...
Hey, Rush, what should I train from now on
to become more awesomer? I can't think of
how to become any more incredible myself...
Go for balance.
Oh yeah? That sounds good.
Combat arts, for sure!
Oh yeah? That sounds good.
Definitely mystic arts!
Oh yeah? That sounds good.
Rush, Rush! You gotta help me
this is very important!
What should I train in? I can't commit, so you decide.
All 'rounder is the way to go.
You know, wishy-washy schmooping around is my
tragic flaw. But since you just made the decision, all I
have to do is blame you when it goes wrong! Thanks!

Mind lending it to me for a while?

What say we pick up some battles, hmm?
Sounds good to me!
Great! Let's get hopping!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Whaaat!?
Start studying
ptalk_embed
Or stick to areas I know? Hmm...
Try something new!
Yes, yes, sounds like that should be good
and powerful.
Focus on what you've got!
Huh, alright.

day and night and I still can't decide.
Try a little of everything.
Hey, that sounds good! Alright, done.
That's what I'm doing.
Combat arts, for sure!
Hey, that sounds good! Alright, done.
That's what I'm doing.
Definitely mystic arts!
You said it! Yup, that's what I'm gonna do!
Ohh, hey, kid. So, I've been thinking about
my training again... Yeah, even a guy like me's
gotta think about the future.
Balance is the key.
Huh...huh, alright. Can't be letting Pagus and
Maddox be the only ones looking like heroes!

Say, Rush, can I maybe borrow your
ptalk_embed
Sure, no prob.
For real? Thanks a million!
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.

Hi-hi, Rush! I really wanna do some training...
Can we go fight monsters, huh, can we can we?
Okay, sure.
Thanks! I promise to get even stronger!
Sorry...maybe later.
Ahh, okay... I guess you're pretty busy, huh...
Hi, Rush. So I was wondering if I should learn

You think? Okay, I'll give it a go...
Hopefully it'll make me stronger!
Focus on what you've got!
Huhhh, so I should study harder so I can learn

for a bit?
Sure, no prob.
Ho ho ho. You have my gratitude.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Coldblooded...
Rush, do we have time to do some fighting
at the nearest battlefield? My usual training
doesn't feel like it was enough today...
Sounds like a plan.
Ho ho ho!
This should be fun!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
...
Should I learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue to refine what I already know?
What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Ho ho ho... Alright.
Let's see what these old bones can do.
Focus on what you've got!
Hum, hum, I see, I see!
Then, I'll continue to train so that I can learn
more powerful spells.

You sound like Sibal... *sigh*
Rush, do you think my training is going in
the correct direction?
I've been a little worried of late.
Try a little of everything.
Ho ho ho, there wouldn't be anything to worry
about in that case, ah.
Focus on combat arts!
Alright!
Believe it or not, I was an army general! I have
utmost confidence in my abilities.
Focus on mystic arts!
Alright!
Believe it or not, I was an army general! I have
utmost confidence in my abilities.

ptalk_embed
so you should take the time to get me one.
Alright!
All according to plan.
Come.
Sorry.
...You will regret this.
That
ptalk_embed
you have.
Give it to me.
Sure!
All according to plan.
Finally, it is mine...
Mmm, no, sorry.
Rrgh... I will remember this.
If you are as free as you seem, then let's
find a place to fight. I'm incredibly bored.
Humor me.
Let's go!
All according to plan.
Let us go.
Sorry... Maybe another time.
Rrgh...
Study
ptalk_embed
, or
to continue one's current studies? ...I realize thinking is
trying for you, but what would you do?
Anything new is worth trying!
Heh. Obviously I had already planned to do that.
Focus on what you know.
Learn more powerful forms of the mystic arts
I know? Of course I've decided to do that.
You gotta choose for yourself.
What a pathetically mitra-like answer.
Learn
ptalk_embed
a brand-new technique, or continue honing my current
skills? You may give your opinion this one and only time.
Anything new is worth trying!
Heh. Obviously I had already planned to do that.
Focus on what you've got!
Learn more powerful forms of the arts
I know? Of course I've decided to do that.
Decide that for yourself.
What a pathetically mitra-like answer.
What sorts of arts should I focus on?
I mean, one does need to worry about
becoming too powerful.
Jack-of-all-trades is ace.
Heh. Obviously.
Combat arts, for sure.
Heh. Obviously.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Heh. Obviously.
What should I focus on now, to become
the perfect fighter? I certainly won't be
outdone by a loser like Torgal.
All 'rounder is the way to go.
Hmm. I suppose that to complete my training,
I can waste a little more time with you people.
Go for the fighting!

Rush, I have need of a
ptalk_embed
Is there time to find one?
Sure, no problem.
Thank you. I am in your debt.
Sorry...maybe later.
A pity.
Would you allow me to borrow your
ptalk_embed
No prob!
Thank you. You've been a big help.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Forgive me. I spoke out of turn.
Rush, do we have time to engage some monsters?
It would not do to slack on training.
Sounds like a plan.
Ahh.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see...
Should I learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue to refine what I already know?
What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
As you say. It should be helpful knowledge.
Focus on what you've got!
Understood. I'll focus on polishing the spells
I know to be as strong as possible.
You should decide.
I was told that before, once...
Should I learn
ptalk_embed
Or continue to refine what I already know?
What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
As you say. It should be helpful knowledge.
Just polish what you've got.
Understood. I'll focus on polishing the
techniques I know to be as strong as
possible.
Decide that for yourself.
I was told that before, once...
How should I focus my training from now on?
I'd value your opinion, Rush.
All-rounder, natch.
An unerring judgment.
Of course, I expected nothing less.
Combat arts, for sure!
An unerring judgment.
Of course, I expected nothing less.
Definitely mystic arts!
An unerring judgment.
Of course, I expected nothing less.
What sorts of arts should I focus on next?
I know I must be strong to do what I must...
Go for balance.
Understood. As captain of the Silver Falcons,
and as a member of this group, I shall
continue to fight for those who cannot.
Combat arts is the way to go.

Boy!
ptalk_embed

Uhh...okay.
Then come
quickly!
Uhh...maybe later.
Impudent whelp...!
What is that...
ptalk_embed
...
Give it to me at once.
Since you asked so nicely...
What a surprisingly pleasant child.
No, I don't think so.
...Smart-mouthed whelp!
Boy! Let us go to the fields of battle and
destroy all in our path! I shall show you
the greatness of the sovani!
Okay, I'm game.
Come!
Uhh...not right now.
Pathetic mitra worm...
To learn
ptalk_embed
or not... If you truly would claim to lead this group,
then you must give your opinion!
Go for it.
Heh... You are wiser than your years...we are
in agreement. This spell would be a great boon
to my skill set.
Stick with what you know.
Heh...we are in agreement. At this point
there is no other choice than to become
even more proficient at my current skills.
Decide that for yourself.
What a pathetically mitra thing to say...

What path should I follow in my training?
I may be perfect, but one can always become
more so...
All-rounder, natch.
If that is the extent of your pitiful desires,
then rejoice, for I shall grant your wish.
Combat arts, for sure!

Rush
I feel great today! My hands itch to
clutch a blade... To feel the sweet resistance
of armor and flesh...
Yeah! Let's go fight!
Heh heh heh heh... Let's go...
I'm busy now, sorry.
Heh...heheheh... Mhmhmhm...
Focus my mystic training... Or start studying
ptalk_embed
...
Try something new!
Mmhmhmhm... It will make me stronger...
Focus on what you've got!
Heheheh...
Then I'll train more...to make my spells more
and more powerful...
Decide that for yourself.
...Mmhmhmhm......
ptalk_embed

I could learn it...
...but...will it make me stronger...?
...Give it a shot?
Heheheheh...
With this, I'll be even stronger...stronger than
before...

Heheheh... Then I will... And become more
and more powerful...
...Whatever you want?
*low chuckle*
Rush, I...
I must become more

Heheheh...heh... But...but how...
Being well-rounded is good!
Really... Is...is that so...
Focus on combat arts!
Really... Is, is that so...

you'd better sell some or give some away.
You can't hold any more accessories, boy.
Come back when you've sold or discarded

money to buy that.
Good heavens, child. You're going to hurt
yourself with all those weapons. You'd
better get rid of some before getting more.
Now then, you know you don't need
that many shields. Why don't you sell
or discard some, hmm?
I'm sorry, dear, but I don't think you can
carry any more accessories. Why don't
you sell or discard some?
That's enough of those, dear, don't you
think? Why don't you sell or discard
some before buying more?
We don't get stock like this often.
Not since the winter of

gives the opportunity to learn a new
Mystic Art, or level up an existing Mystic Art. You may
choose the art you would like to learn from a list.
Captured monsters may be
split
for components.
However, intact monsters may be sold in certain shops
for high prices. Choose wisely
you only get the choice
to split a monster once.
Once certain monsters have been sold to shops,
those shops may begin selling
trade goods
This is how units in the party can request certain loot.
Units try to collect items to strengthen their equipment.
A unit's request for an item can be removed
from the list by selecting them.
Battle Controls
Pressing
Left or Right switches targets, while
pressing
Up and Down selects battle commands.

Battle
Each entity in a battle is called a
unit
These units are organized into groups, called
unions
In battle, you will
command friendly unions for
large-scale assaults
. The specific directions you may
give are displayed as
battle commands
At the top right of the screen is a
battle
navigation map
showing the positions of
all unions engaged in battle.
Available battle commands change depending on
conditions such as the positions and makeup of
friendly and enemy unions. Keep these conditions in
mind to give appropriate battle orders.
Morale
The large red and blue bar across the top of the screen
is called the
Morale Gauge
. It measures you and your
enemies' will to fight.
As morale rises, attacks become stronger and more
effective. Conversely, as morale falls, defenses weaken
and unions do less damage.
Morale fluctuates
based on the performance of both
sides in battle
. Make it a habit to keep track of your
troops' morale.
Critical Trigger
Sometimes during battle, a
Trigger Chance
will occur.
During a Trigger Chance, you'll be given a brief opportunity
to press a certain button on the controller.
A well-timed button press will launch a
Critical Trigger
giving your side a definite advantage in battle.
Successful Trigger Chances while on the attack will
launch a
Critical Offense
. This will cause the next
friendly unit to act faster than usual.
Successful Trigger Chances while being attacked
launch a
Critical Defense
. This can change a simple
block to a shield bash, or a dodge to a counterattack.
If you find you just can't keep up with the timing,
Critical Triggers can be switched to occur
automatically through the Config Menu.
Critical Trigger Settings
have been added to
the Config Menu!
Guest Unions
When a
guest union
joins the party,
you cannot assign
it battle commands
it acts on its own. See if you can
determine how to support your guest in battles!
Enemy Advantage
If you are touched by a monster in the field,
the following battle will be to the
enemy's
advantage
. This can be avoided by
engaging
monsters
in battle yourself.
KO
A union's HP is the sum of each member's HP.
Instead of worrying about the HP of individual
units, watch that of the union instead. If the
union's HP falls to 0, then the whole union is
Incapacitated
, and will be unable to act.
Botch
If a union's leader falls in battle, it is a
Botch
Afterwards, that union can no longer accept battle
commands, meaning the remaining members
cannot be commanded.
Flank Ataque
When in Deadlock, if a union is attacked from the
side, it is known as a
Flank Ataque
. It is possible
to be flanked by two unions at a time.
Unions performing Flank Attacks deal extra damage
Rear Assault
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by
two unions, any further unions Deadlocking the
victim union launch a
Rear Assault
Unions performing Rear Assaults deal extra damage
Massive Strike
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by
two unions and Rear Assaulted by a third, any
further unions Deadlocking the victim union
launch a
Massive Strike
Unions participating
in a Massive Strike deal extra damage
Deadlock Interference
If an enemy union is attempting to Deadlock a
friendly union but instead is caught in Deadlock
itself, this is called
Interference
When it's the player's side that gets caught,
it is called
Interception
Raidlock
It is possible to force a union into Deadlock without
being physically nearby. This is called a
Raidlock
Damage dealt increases during a Raidlock.
Directing units to use mystic attacks will make
them
channel energy through their weapons to
perform mystic arts
. Mystic arts encompass
everything from long-range attacks to recovery
spells. However, they can take a long time to cast.
When you direct units to do physical attacks, they'll
attack with their equipped weapon, or perform
combat arts
. You can learn different combat arts
depending on your wield style, so try different
combinations and see what happens.

Action Point
Strategies
Every time a unit performs arts in battle, AP is consumed.
However,
AP is recovered each turn
, so don't feel like
you have to go out of your way to conserve it.
Item arts consume materials, and thus do not consume AP.
Each character in battle is called a
unit
, and can be
grouped into
unions
through the Union Board on the
main menu.
Unions share aggregate HP and AP, and
act as a single entity in battle
. A union's makeup can
have a dramatic impact on battles. Try different combos!
Units can be grouped into unions through the
Union Board
on the main menu. By arranging unions,
you can
cover the units' specific weaknesses and take
advantage of their strengths
. There are countless
combinations of units
try to find the most effective ones.
The myriad skills a unit learns are known as
arts
Arts become more powerful as they are used.
Frequently using arts in the same category
enables the user to learn stronger arts of that category.
Rush is able to learn many types of arts.
By focusing on
armed combat
, he learns
combat arts
By finding
gems
that allow one to focus mystic
energy, he may learn
mystic arts
. By finding
recipes
for crafting, he can learn
item arts
Special physical attacks performed with weapons are
called
combat arts
. Combat arts differ based on the
equipped weapon and wield style. Make certain to do
plenty of experimentation if you wish to get them all.
Channeling arcane energy through weapons is known
as
mystic arts
. Mystic arts encompass a wide range
of skills, from long-range attacks to recovery spells.
However, they take time to cast, requiring some degree
of planning.
Invocations
are close-range mystic attack spells.
Evocations
are long-range mystic attack spells.
Hexes
are status-affecting support spells.
Remedies
are spells that recover status or HP.
Psionics
allow casters to control the actions of foes.
Wards
allow casters to support allies.
Item arts
are skills using consumables to create
useful things such as potions or herbs. Item arts
consume items instead of AP, and are relatively
quick to cast. Consumables can be found in specialty
shops, or by harvesting in the field.
Herbs
combine plants for recovery.
Potions
combine liquids for useful supplements.
Lotions
combine medicines to make healing balms.
Explosives
combine explosive powders.
Shards
can be fused and used for attacks.
Traps
are made from special parts to trip up the foe.
The
one-handed
wield style is speedy and allows for
users to equip a shield. However, its attack power is low.
Power grip
wield style has increased
strength, but attacks take longer.
Dual wield
style is unmatched in attack
power, but makes it nigh impossible to avoid attacks.
Sovani can
quad wield
, using four weapons at once
for crushing attack strength. Their
dual power grip
delivers even more powerful blows. However, both
types of attacks take longer to pull off.
Certain battle commands can allow a unit to change
wield styles during battle. This is limited by the type
of weapon the unit currently has equipped. For
example, if a unit equips a two-handed weapon,
it cannot change its wield style from two-handed.
Equipment comes in four sizes: small, midsize, large,
and huge. In general, the sizes are split by race:
qsiti small and midsize, mitra midsize and large,
and yama large and huge. Sovani are limited to
special sovani weapons, and do not use shields.
When units are placed on the Union Board, they may
be arranged in special patterns called
formations
Formations grant unions certain effects in battle
They are learnt and improved through special items
found across the world, so keep an eye out.
When units are placed in a formation,
units in the
lead ranks have increased physical attack and defense
while
units in the back ranks have increased
mystic attack and defense
. Keep this in
mind when arranging your units.
Some formations can level up when certain
conditions are met. While formations already grant
certain bonuses to different stats, these
variant
formations
will grant even greater bonuses.
When unions are caught in close combat, it is
known as
Deadlock
. In such situations, the two
unions are set in what they may target. If a Deadlocked
union is commanded to perform long-range attacks,
support skills, or movements, Deadlock is broken.
Canceling Deadlock leaves a union wide open to
attack and gives the opposite union a large
damage bonus. Keep this in mind.
If a Deadlocked union is melee attacked from the
side, it is known as a
Flank Ataque
. It is possible
to be flanked by two unions at a time.
Unions performing Flank Attacks deal extra damage.
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by
two unions, any further union Deadlocking the
victim union launches a
Rear Assault
Unions performing Rear Assaults deal extra damage.
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by
two unions and Rear Assaulted by a third, any
further unions Deadlocking the victim union
launch a
Massive Strike
Unions participating
in a Massive Strike deal extra damage
Some special unions, such as those containing certain
extremely large units, are able to Deadlock multiple unions
at once. This is called a
Multi Deadlock
A union victim to a Flank Ataque, Rear Assault, or
Massive Strike will be hit for additional damage.
The damage bonus for Rear Assault and Massive
Strike is greater than that for Flank Ataque.
It is possible to force a union into Deadlock without
being physically near. This is called a
Raidlock
While raiding, the target union is hit for extra damage,
but the raid only lasts for one turn.
Weapons come in three main categories, dealing certain types of damage:
* Swords and katana, or
blades
, mainly deal
slashing damage
* Axes and maces, or
breakers
, mainly deal
mauling damage
* Spears and staves, or
polearms
, mainly deal
bludgeoning
or
piercing damage
Be mindful of the types of weapons units equip when forming unions.
Weapons also have
attack strength
parry rate
weight
, and
damage absorption
stats.
* Ataque strength affects the amount of damage dealt.
* Parry rate affects the likelihood of Critical Triggers.
* Weight affects the action order.
* Damage absorption alleviates the HP lost by attacks.
While not all of these stats display in menus, be mindful
of units' weapons when forming unions.
Weapons and combat arts all deal
slashing
bludgeoning
mauling
, or
piercing damage
These attributes can add to the damage dealt to a target.
If a union's leader falls in battle, it is a
Botch
Afterwards,
that union can no longer accept battle
commands
, meaning the remaining members
cannot be commanded.
If a unit has a single one-handed weapon equipped,
it may also equip a shield. Shields are beneficial
for
evading attacks
When a unit continues to engage and defeat enemies,
battle chain
is formed. As chains become higher,
player units grow at a faster rate. Getting ambushed
or returning to the World Map will break the chain.
A count is kept of the
number of enemy units
defeated per battle
. As this count rises, the amount
and quality of loot dropped by the monsters rises as well.
Necklaces
tend to raise mystic defense.
Rings
tend to raise intellect.
Bracelets
tend to raise HP.
Earrings
tend to raise physical defense.
Belts
tend to raise strength.
Anklets
tend to raise speed.
Amulets
tend to raise AP.
Gems
are special types of accessories
granting benefits like no other.
Sometimes after defeating a monster, you may capture
it, and the option is given to split it into component
items. Alternately, monsters may be sold intact to
shops for a high price. Choose to split or not depending
on your need.
Selling captured monsters to shops increases your
commerce points
. Once your commerce points
have reached a certain level, shops will begin offering
trade goods
Certain items gained by harvesting or defeating
monsters are known as
components
. Components
can be used at customization shops to enhance
or create new equipment. Some components may
also be purchased.
Components can be gained by splitting captured
monsters for parts. In fact, some components can
only be obtained in this manner. Moving the cursor
over captured monsters on the battle results screen
will show what items would be gained upon splitting them.
Some components can be gained by disassembling
weapons at customization shops. In fact, some
components can only be obtained in this manner.
Moving the cursor over the equipment while in the
customization shop menu will show what items
would be gained upon disassembling it.
Some monsters will not drop components until
you have acquired certain rare items.
Each unit has its own
stats
Strength, Intellect, and Speed.
Strength
affects physical attack and defense.
Intellect
affects mystic attack and defense.
Speed
affects action order and evasion.
Each unit's stats affect the performance of the
whole union, so keep them in mind.
Units improve their stats by participating in battles.
Harsher monsters give players bigger boosts.
Each character has his own unique stat. Even if it seems
to be useless at first glance, the time may come when it
has a significant effect.
Performance in battle affects units' morale. As one
might expect, high morale increases performance,
while units with low morale are not as effective.
The morale of both the friendly and enemy forces
is displayed across the top of the screen.
If a Critical Offense is successful as part of a
combo
the next player unit to act is bumped up to the next
action, and will also be granted a Critical Offense.
Additionally, the attack of the final unit to act in that
union will deal a critical hit.
When a targeted unit successfully blocks an attack
with a weapon, the damage it would have received
is completely nullified. Sometimes, the Critical Defense
Parry
is performed, not only nullifying damage but
inflicting Blacked Out status on the attacker.
When a unit successfully blocks an attack with a
shield, the damage it would have received is
completely nullified. Sometimes, the Critical
Defense
Shield Bash
is performed, not only
nullifying damage but inflicting damage on the
attacker.
When a unit successfully dodges an attack, the
damage it would have received is completely
nullified. Sometimes, the Critical Defense
Counterattack
is performed, not only
nullifying damage, but inflicting damage on the
attacker.
* When a unit is
Blacked Out
it cannot act or react until the turn ends.
Petrification
means the unit is turning to stone.
Each damaging attack has a chance to cause KO.
Shocked
units have 0 defense against
thunder and do not get Critical Triggers.
Burned
units have 0 defense against fire,
and always act last.
Frozen
units have 0 defense against ice,
and do not get extra attacks.
Acid Burn
units have 0 defense against poison,
and their Special Defense falls to 0.
* Units blessed with
Protection
are surrounded by a wall of mystic energy, fully
blocking 1 physical attack.
* Units covered by an
Orphic Ward
are surrounded by a wall of mystic energy, fully
blocking 1 mystic attack.
* Units with the status
Phys Eater
absorb as HP all physical damage received
for a set number of turns.
* Units with the status
Mystic Eater
absorb as HP all mystic damage received
for a set number of turns.
Paralyzed
unions are blocked from using
combat arts for a set number of turns.
Silenced
unions are blocked from using
mystic arts for a set number of turns.
Poisoned
unions lose a percentage
of HP after each unit's turn.
Cursed
unions have the chance of
instant death before each unit's action.
Enfeitiçado
unions are ensorcelled to mistake
friend for foe, and thus attack the wrong side
until the end of battle.
* Unions with
Decoy
status
attract all enemy attention
and attacks.
* Unions with
Stealth
status
cannot be caught in Deadlock.
* Unions with
Charge Up
status
receive an additional amount of AP each turn.
* Unions with
Charge Down
status
receive a reduced amount of AP each turn.
* Unions with
STR Up
INT Up
, or
SPD Up
statuses receive boosts to stats.
* Unions with
STR Down
INT Down
, or
SPD Down
statuses receive cuts to stats.
* Unions with
ATK Up
DEF Up
, or
Evasion Up
statuses receive boosts to those stats.
* Unions with
ATK Down
DEF Down
, or
Evasion Down
statuses receive cuts to those stats.
By befriending the mysterious being Mr. Diggs, you
may use harvesting points to get components useful
for customization. Try taking Mr. Diggs to many
places to see what you can find.
The components that can be harvested differ
according to the type of harvesting point.
Digging Points
have rocks, ore, and gems.
Felling Points
have trees and flowers.
Underwater Diving Points
have precious metals.
Underground Diving Points
have natural resources
such as water or oil.
Sometimes, special harvest points appear on the map.
These locations are rumored to have
buried treasure
The items found here are especially rare. However,
you can only make one attempt to retrieve them.
Unnaturally good at harvesting items, and almost
definitely alive,
Mr. Diggs
can become even better
at harvesting through practice. The more it tries,
the more and better quality items it can retrieve.
The number of times Mr. Diggs can harvest is
displayed as the
Digs Count
This number can be increased by possessing certain
items. The count is reset on returning to the World Map
so feel free to harvest freely.
During harvesting, a
Loop Chance
may occur
a rare happening when Mr. Diggs's true abilities are
unlocked, and it harvests to the best of its abilities,
sometimes finding huge treasure troves. With luck,
you could find yourself with more items than you
even know what to do with.
Sometimes, odd things happen to Mr. Diggs, putting you
on
alert
. Anything could happen...
* Rush is covered in a Terrify Aura
* Rush is covered in a Charm Aura
* Rush is covered in a Provoke Aura
* Mr. Diggs's action count goes to minimum
* Mr. Diggs's action count is restored
* Nearby monsters are angered
A monster's status can be determined by
checking the icon above its head.
Pressing
722
left and right calls up
the target cursor. Placing the target cursor over
a monster will show its name and stats.
Monsters have three states. You can determine a
monster's attitude by checking the icon above its head.
Monsters with
+**
0**
will flee when you get close.
Monsters with
+**
/**
will attack when you get close.
Monsters with
+**
A*
seem calm, but if you get too
close, who knows what they'll do?
Monsters with
+**
2**
are completely enraged.
They will attack you.
Monsters with
+**
,**
are charmed by Rush.
They will not attack.
Monsters in either of these states will follow Rush
anywhere.
Around the world are incredibly strong beasts who
are known for their exceptional strength.
Sometimes it's difficult to tell them from average
monsters, but if you check their status with your
target cursor, their name appears in a different
color than usual
so beware!
Press
>@
to Timeshift, slowing the flow
of time for a short while. When in Timeshift, nearby
monsters will be marked as encounterable.
Pulling
?@
while in Timeshift
will launch a battle with all marked monsters, even
if the marked monsters are currently out of range.
If you have not pulled
?@
by the end of Timeshift,
monsters will attack you.
+**
2**
means the monsters are completely
enraged, and will chase Rush anywhere.
After a Timeshift, Rush cannot Timeshift again
until the Timeshift gauge is restored.
If a battle is initiated while in Timeshift,
the gauge will be fully restored afterwards.
When in towns or on the field, the auto-camera may
be adjusted to two different levels with
722
Additionally, auto-follow can be turned off, and you
may adjust the viewing angle as you like. This can be
switched through the Config menu.
Enemies or NPCs may be targeted with
722
You can switch targets by scrolling left and right with
722
or lock onto a target with
=@
, to keep them at the
center of the screen.
During battle, while entering commands, the viewpoint
can be changed with
By pulling
?@
, monsters within
a certain range can be drawn into battle.
Monsters with icons
-**
C**
above their heads
are close enough to be encountered.
If a monster on the field attacks you before you have
a chance to attack it,
you will be at a distinct
disadvantage
in the ensuing battle. Be forewarned.
Pulling
?@
when there are no monsters
in range launches an
Aggro Pull
Aggro Pulling the enemy makes them angry.
+**
2**
means the monsters are completely
enraged, and will chase Rush anywhere.
Monsters that have seen Rush may bring nearby

Pubs
are a great source of information on
happenings in the world. Even the smallest of
villages has a pub, a clearinghouse for the latest
news.
When in doubt, first speak with the bartender.
Many characters offering quests gather in pubs.
When you don't have enough members in your party,
try hiring some muscle at a
guild
As you progress through the game, stronger and
more varied mercenaries will become available.
Guild Tasks
are completely optional quests.
All that's needed is to fulfill the conditions for
them to be completed. Check the task list at guilds
for more information.
After battle, sometimes friendly units want the spoils
of your last battle. They do not claim items at
random, but
search for items to customize their
equipment
. If you give them the items, they will
have better gear.
When a new union enters the battlefield, the side
it is supporting is
Reinforced
. Reinforcement
may correspond to anything from a large linked
battle, or the effects of an enemy skill.
Interference
is a state in which the player union or
an ally union forces an enemy union, which has a different
union targeted for Deadlock, into a Deadlock.
This is called
Interception
when done by an enemy union
to the player union or an ally union.
The game can generally be saved anywhere
the Party Menu can be opened.
Game progress can also be saved on
World and City Maps.
Questgivers are generally found in pubs.
Talk to the pub staff to hear the latest
rumors surrounding currently available quests.
Different rumors can be heard in different towns.
When specific characters join your party,
you can find and talk to them when visiting
their hometowns. The conversations you
have change the more you talk to them
and help them out.
Even if given the same battle command,
depending on the unit, the action it
takes may differ. It is up to you whether
to place emphasis on the unit or the action
in question.
Unleashing a Remnant's power or summoning
a Remnant using Arcana can be done through
Special Commands
. This command appears when
fighting tough opponents, or when you have
lots of morale during battle, for example.
Spells referred to as
Arcana
can be
unleashed when several units' spells get released
together. Once an Arcana spell is unleashed,
it will appear as an option in the Special Commands.
