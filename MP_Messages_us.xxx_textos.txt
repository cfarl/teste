Heya, kid! This yer first time in Athlum?\nThis is Xiphos Way.\nKeep going down this way, an' you'll hit the\nTown Square. Veer off from there an' you can\nhead out to Virtus Parish.
Hey, you been keepin' up with that Conqueror\nguy an' his army?\nThey're just a bunch o' thugs that'll do\nanything to get hold of a Remnant... Bet they'd\nsell their mama for somethin' cheap, too!\nTalking 'bout them's all the rage here\nsome\nsay they even wanna take over the world!\nThey're a shady bunch, that's fer sure!
[[3rd Level Message]]
Damn that Conqueror!\nTakin' away our Lady Emma an' the Valeria Heart...!\nWithout 'em, the whole town's become greyer...\nDammit!
Huhhh, so is that Conqueror bastard really\ns'posed to be dead?\nRumor is, his army wasn't completely\ndestroyed... Damned if there's anything I\nwouldn't rather hear, though.
Hey, didja hear? Athlum's finally got free from\nCelapaleis!\n'S been a long time since we had any good news.\nKinda feels like karma's finally payin' us back!
If Lord David's goin' toe-to-toe with this Conqueror\nguy, the outcome's already decided!\nYeahhh, that guy can bring it all he wants\nhe's just\ngonna get beat down! Tear 'im a new one for Lady Emma!
Equipment shops, item shops, customization\nshops...\nXiphos Way has it all.\nThis is the place in Athlum to shop!

The Valeria Heart was lost, and with it,\neveryone's hopes... People walk down the\nstreets like they haven't a friend in the world.\nBut...this is no time to wallow in sadness!\nSqueezing out a smile is the job of a merchant,\nisn't it?\nWhat we've got to do is make lots of top-quality\nweapons and armor, as if to say "take that,\nConqueror!"
Ever since Duke Ghor became chairman of the\nCongress, supply patterns have changed a lot!\nI guess all the stuff that used to be saved especially\nfor Nagapur is being routed to other cities.
To think, Athlum's become an independent state!\nYou see the people walking around? Compared to before,\nit's like night and day. Everyone's so full of hope...\nLooks like they'll be in the mood for buying, too,\nwhich makes me happy!
Ignoring the God Emperor's orders and fighting the\nConqueror... I can't quite say that I think it's a good thing\nor not.\nBut...I trust Lord David. He's not gonna steer us wrong!\nThe rest of us shopkeepers, too, of course! Good luck,\nAthlum!
That large sword is this town's Remnant. It's looked\nafter the people of this town for centuries, you know.\nWhen I was just a little girl and I was feeling down,\nI'd go out to the Town Square.\nIt sounds strange, but just looking at the Remnant\nalways made me feel better.
Some men calling themselves "the Conquerors"\nor something are plotting to attack the city, I heard...\nThat's so silly, isn't it? We've got the Marquis\nand the generals to take care of us. Plus, the\nValeria Heart will protect us, no matter what.\nWhoever these guys are, who cares? They can't do\nanything, so it's not even worth worrying about.
The sword...it's gone.\nI can't stop looking up, it's force of habit...\nbut there's nothing there.\nWhat's going to happen to us?
I heard the army's supposed to be finding some\nnew Remnant to replace the Valeria Heart.\nLike anything could!\nBesides... I've already gotten used to seeing\nthe sky without it...
Have you heard? Athlum's become independent of\nCelapaleis.\nIt warms me to hear it... Even though the Valeria Heart\nis gone, it still watches over us...
The Athlumian Guard will march on the Conqueror's\narmy... I truly hope everyone can return safely.\nSomehow, the Valeria Heart will look over them, I'm\nsure of it...
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...\nYou there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?\nYeah...why?\nYou're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...\nLord David put out a summons...he said he needed to\nspeak with you about something. Hurry to the\ncastle
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere\nif you're\nplaying at all.\nLord David put out a summons...he said he needed to\nspeak with you about something. Hurry to the\ncastle
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...\nYou're Rush Sykes, right?\nYup, I'm Rush!\nWho, me? Couldn't be!
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.\nHe says he's come up with a good starting place for\ninformation-gathering, and that you should come to\nthe\ncastle\nfor details.\nGot it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,\nthough\nyou're not in trouble...not with us at least.\nLord David's put out a summons for you.\nApparently he's come up with a good starting place for\nyour information-gathering, so he'd like you to come\nto the\ncastle\nso he can share it with you.\nDon't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you\nmight end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...\nYou must be Rush Sykes, are you not?\nThe one and only!\nDepends on who's asking.
Well met!\nDavid, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come\nto\nAthlum Castle\nat your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!\nI bring a message from Lord David. He requests that\nyou come to the\ncastle\nat your nearest convenience.
Sorry, man, I'm still setting up.\nWhen'll I be open?\nHuh, good question!
The customization shop is open for business!\n[[customization menu]]

Is this your first trip to Athlum?\nI'm sure you'll feel right at home in our pleasant\nlittle burg.
This is Xiphos Way, famous for its diverse\nselection in shops.
This shop's selection is out of this world...\nAnd I can't even afford the items on sale.
This is the town square, where Athlum's denizens\ncome to relax.
I used to come here often with my wife.\nHow I miss her...
Ya see that huge sword over there?\nThat's the soul of Athlum--the Valeria Heart!
You see how the sunlight bounces off\nthe Valeria Heart, making it sparkle like that?\nMy grandpa said that each sparkle is a ray of hope\nfor Athlum, and for Lord David's reign!
I always end up here when I'm tired, or feeling\nblue, or just having a bad day.\nSeeing the Valeria Heart in all its glory somehow\nmakes everything all better.
This is Virtus Parish.
I'm parched from being on duty all day.\nTime to hit the pub for a nice cold one!
You've heard of the Gaslin Caves--the ones near\nthe lake to the south, right?\nThey say there's a flower down there so rare that\nonly a few have seen it. Don't even think about it,\nkid. It's way too dangerous for you.
Sorry, but I'm still setting up shop.\nWhy don't you come back later?

Essa é a Praça da Cidade, onde o orgulhoso povo de\nAthlum vem para relaxar e descontrair.\nTudo que você precisa, de acessórios a armas, pode\nser adquirido aqui.\nRecomendo a você dar uma olhada em volta.
Os soldados que foram até as Ruínas de Robélia ainda\nnão voltaram...Se a Senhora Emma pudesse investigar...
O que há de errado? Você parece perdido. Se precisa\nde informação, visite a\ntaverna\n. Se está querendo expandir seu grupo,\nvisite a\nguilda.
Enfrentar o Conquistador foi como usar mosquitos para\ntentar derrubar o Gwayn. Fomos completamente\nesmagados...\nMas pelo menos, posso ficar vigiando a\npraça que a Senhora Emma deu sua vida para proteger.
O Conselho convocou uma nova reunião, e Lorde David\nestá ocupado procurando novos Remanescentes.\nOs mercadores daqui também estão fazendo sua parte,\ncolocando em dia\ntodo seu novo\nestoque.
Todos estão dizendo que Athlum alcançou sua\nindependência graças aos esforços de Lorde David.\nAssim sendo, vou fazer meu melhor para\npromover o orgulho de Athlum, vigiando essa praça!
Eu também queria ajudar na luta contra o\nConquistador...\nMas alguém tinha que ficar para proteger a Praça...\nVou fazer o que puder daqui, por isso estou dependendo\nde vocês para tomar conta do resto!
Você deve ser Rush Sykes.\nOuvi muito a seu respeito, de Lorde David.\nTodos aqui são um tanto excêntricos, mas são todos\nbons guerreiros. Se precisar de ajuda,\nsabe onde encontrar.
Esse Remanescente é o coração da nossa cidade.\nEle é conhecido como o Coração Valeriano.\nEle representa a virtude da bravura.\nTempos atrás, a cidade sofreu numerosos desastres.\nMas um dia, essa enorme espada caiu do céu, e\ndaquele momento em diante, nada mais perturbou essas\nterras...ao menos, é isso que diz a lenda.\nAssim, enquanto o Coração Valeriano existir,\nAthlum não cairá.\nSe estiver desencorajado, reze ao Coração Valeriano.\nSeu espírito será tranquilizado.
Há muitas histórias recentes sobre problemas causados\npor um canalha que se autodenomina Conquistador...\nMas não há porque se preocupar aqui em Athlum.\nConfie no Coração Valeriano.\nNão temos nada a temer.
[[Mensagem do 3º Nível]]
O Coração Valeriano foi tomado de nós...\nO Remanescente que acreditamos que iria nos proteger\nde todo o mal que nos ameaçasse. Isso...isso não pode\nter sido mera superstição...
Ouvi dizer dos mercadores que Nagapur foi destruída.\nVivi toda minha vida pensando que Remanescentes eram\nanjos guardiões que estavam aqui para nos proteger.\nAgora, já não estou mais tão certo disso...
Nunca imaginei que viveria para ver o dia em que\nAthlum estaria sob seu próprio controle...\nNa verdade, nem tudo na vida é sofrimento.
Posso apenas rezar para sairmos dessa em segurança.
O governante de Athlum, Lorde David, se preocupa com\nseu povo e ouve seus pedidos com um coração atencioso.\nO antigo Marquês morreu quando Lorde David ainda era\nmuito jovem, mas mesmo assim ele cresceu e se tornou\num grande governante, por si mesmo!\nEle até mesmo recebeu a arma mais forte da cidade\nde Athlum, o Gae Bolg. Não vejo ninguém mais\napropriado para o trabalho.
Ei... Isso não é conhecido por todos, mas como você\nestima o Marquês como eu, vou contar um segredo...\nDizem que toda vez que o antigo Marquês usava o Gae\nBolg, ele levava embora um pequeno pedaço da sua alma!\nÉ por isso que ele morreu tão jovem.\nAgora, Lorde David está trabalhando duro e lutando para\nnos proteger... Quanto dano isso está causando?\nEspero que a paz seja rapidamente alcançada, para que\nLorde David possa retornar com corpo e alma intactos!
Antes da General Honeywell...antes de a perdermos,\nela estava sempre ao lado de Lorde David. Eles devem\nter sido muito próximos...\nAgora que ela morreu, quem sabe o quão dolorido isso\ntudo deve estar sendo para Lorde David?\nSerá que há algo a se fazer para diminuir essa dor?
Mesmo depois de perder o Coração Valeriano e a\nSenhora Emma, Lorde David não perdeu o ritmo, indo\npara o campo de batalha para liderar as tropas.\nÉ comovente, não? Ele está conduzindo Athlum a um\nfuturo brilhante, sei disso.
Agora que Athlum alcançou sua independência, Lorde\nDavid vai ter de assumir uma grande responsabilidade...\nMas estou certo que pode lidar com isso. Ele pode até\nmesmo superar o antigo Marquês... Com Lorde David no\ncomando, o futuro de Athlum é brilhante, sem dúvida!
Enfrentar o Conquistador... Sem dúvida Lorde David\ntomou essa decisão depois de pensar muito no assunto.\nTudo que posso fazer agora é confiar nele, e esperar\nque ele possa cuidar disso rapidamente; assim poderemos\ndeixar tudo isso para trás e construir um novo futuro.
Aquela luta contra os monstros na Planície Yamarn foi\num enorme sucesso. Lorde David e seu Gae Bolg acabaram\ncom aqueles monstros com um só golpe!\nSim, ninguém consegue resistir à boa e velha Athlum!\nRaios, acho que isso merece uma comemoração!\nEi, vovô! Dê para mim um corte da sua melhor carne!
Minha nossa... Todo mundo aqui esteve tagarelando sem\nparar sobre um sujeito sinistro chamado Conquistador\nou coisa parecida.\nParece que ele está andando por aí e atacando estados\na torto e a direito! Ninguém sabe quanto tempo vai\ndemorar até sermos arrastados para o meio disso...\nEi, vovô! Dê para mim alguma coisa saudável...\nAcho que vou precisar disso!
Inacreditável!\nA Senhora Emma...morta!?\nComo isso aconteceu? Os Quatro Generais de Athlum são\nos guerreiros mais fortes que existem... Certo, vovô?
Então, dizem que o novo presidente do Conselho, esse\ntal de Ghor ou coisa parecida, pediu para Lorde David\nir atrás de outros grandes Remanescentes.\nSério, você acha que pode tropeçar\neles andando pela rua?\nSe fosse tão fácil encontrá-los, você os veria nas\nlojas daqui o tempo todo, não é, vovô?
Lorde David é incrível! Não consigo acreditar que ele\nconseguiu mesmo a independência de Athlum!\nVovô, dê para mim seu melhor corte de carne!\nEssa noite vamos festejar!
Que Conquistador o quê, quem é que tem medo daquele\ncabeça de queijo? Nós não! Ninguém ameaça Athlum!\nEnfim, por via das dúvidas, é melhor estar em forma\npara lutar. Vovô, não me importa o que vai dar para\nmim, mas faça alguma coisa para me deixar forte!
Não vou sair daqui,\nnem mesmo se você me pedir!\nEsse é meu lugar favorito na cidade... Sinto-me tão\nperto do Coração Valeriano\nque é quase como se fôssemos um só.
Pensei que poderia confiar nessa gente...\nDeveria ter feito eu mesmo, desde o início.
Mas olhe só até onde cheguei sozinho... Eu acho...\nEu acho que PRECISO da ajuda de outras pessoas...
Hmm? Rosto aborrecido, roupas extravagantes, ombros\ncaídos... Você aí, você não é Rush Sykes?\nSim...por quê?\nVocê está enganado, velho.
O quêêê? Seu pequeno atrevido...\nLorde David fez uma convocação...ele disse que\nprecisava falar com você. Corra para o\ncastelo
*bufando* Se fingir de tolo não vai levá-lo a lugar\nalgum, se é isso que\nestá fazendo.\nLorde David fez uma convocação...ele disse que\nprecisava falar com você. Corra para o\ncastelo
Huh? Sim...esse rosto, essas roupas...\nVocê deve ser Rush Sykes, certo?\nSim, sou o Rush!\n...Não?
Foi o que pensei! Tenho uma mensagem para você,\nde Lorde David. Ele disse que encontrou um bom lugar\npara iniciar a coleta de informações, e disse que você\ndeve ir até o\ncastelo\npara mais detalhes.\nEntendeu?
Hahaha, você é um péssimo ator, garoto.\nMas não se preocupe,\nvocê não está encrencado...pelo menos, não conosco.\nLorde David está te convocando.\nParece que ele encontrou um bom lugar para iniciar a\ncoleta de informações, e por isso ele quer que você vá\naté o\ncastelo\npara poderem conversar.\nNão o deixe esperando, certo, garoto? Senão pode mesmo\nacabar tendo problemas com a gente... Estou brincando!
Ohh! Essa figura valente...\nVocê deve ser Rush Sykes, não é mesmo?\nO primeiro e único!\nDepende de quem está perguntando.
Muito bem!\nLorde David, Marquês de Athlum, requisita sua presença\nno\nCastelo de Athlum\nassim que possível.
Ha ha ha, você está sendo malandro como sempre!\nTrago uma mensagem de Lorde David. Ele solicita que\nvocê vá ao\ncastelo\nassim que possível.
Oh, olá.\nNão quero ser rude, mas tenho algumas coisas\npara fazer, se me dão licença.
Olá, Rush. Sabe, também tenho uma irmã mais nova.\nEla está morando aqui em Athlum...Não é ruim trabalhar\ntanto, sabendo que ela está me esperando em casa.\nÉ por isso que sempre compro pequenas bugigangas com\nmeus pagamentos... São presentes para ela.\nEstou sempre de olho em coisas que ela possa gostar.
Eu também tenho uma irmã mais nova. Ela adora quando\ntrago presentes das minhas viagens, por isso sempre\nprocuro alguma coisa boa para ela.
Ahh... Estar de volta na Praça me traz de volta as\nlembranças de quando eu era uma apenas um garoto...\nQuando era mais jovem, andava em más companhias.\nPerdia meu tempo arrumando briga, causando problemas.\nEu e minha turma ficávamos horas vadiando na praça...\nHeh, deve soar estranho essa nostalgia de delinquente.\nMeus companheiros morreram na guerra... ao olhar para\ntrás, vejo que estava perdido...toda turma bastaria.
Quando era garoto, era um pequeno desordeiro, eu era.\nPerdia meus dias arrumando briga e causando problemas.\nAgora sou pago para acabar com problemas...heh.
Ahh, Rush. Posso falar com você um minuto?\nRecentemente, minha irmã vem agindo de forma estranha.\nEu trouxe presentes, mas ela parece não se importar.\nNão sei... acho que ela ainda não me perdoou...\n...\nEu te disse que era bastante encrenqueiro, lembra?\nÉ um pouco mais sério que isso. Porque há um tempo,\nfiz uma coisa muito, muito ruim.\nTodos os dias eu saia com a turma. Minha irmã\nera apenas um bebê, mas eu a deixava sozinha em casa.\nE um dia, os homens-besta invadiram a casa...\nCorri para casa como um raio, mas já era muito tarde.\nMinha irmã estava ali deitada, com as pernas esmagadas.\nA única responsabilidade que tinha na vida era cuidar\nda minha irmã, mas quando ela precisou mesmo de mim,\nfalhei... Poderia ter cortado suas pernas eu mesmo.\nDepois disso, jurei voltar ao bom caminho. Comecei a\ntrabalhar como mercenário para ganhar dinheiro...\nQueria comprar coisas para deixar sua vida um pouco\nmelhor. Mas não parecia estar fazendo nenhum progresso.\nEstou perdido, Rush, não sei o que fazer...
A única coisa que me restou na vida foi minha irmã,\nmas eu não estava com ela quando precisou de mim...\nEu poderia ter cortado suas pernas eu mesmo...
Oho, olá, Rush.\nDepois que nos falamos, visitei minha irmã. Eu não\ntinha a menor ideia do que fazer ou dizer para fazer\nas pazes, então acabei falando das minhas aventuras.\nBelas paisagens, bestas terríveis, bons amigos...\nVocê sabe, todas as coisas que acontecem numa viagem.\nAchei que estava aborrecendo ela, mas olhei para cima\ne ela estava me encarando, os olhos brilhando, pedindo\n"termine a história!" Você não sabe quanto tempo\nse passou desde que a vi tão feliz...\nFoi quando me dei conta... Estive fazendo tudo errado.\nEstive tentando conquistar minha irmã com dinheiro e\ncoisas materiais... Não é isso que ela queria.\nOlhando para trás, é óbvio ela estar me encarando.\nNão pude deixar de me sentir como um idiota...\nRush, pode não parecer muito, mas finalmente fui capaz\nde começar a fazer as pazes pelo que fiz.\nEntão... Como eu digo isso...\nEstou dependendo de você de agora em diante.\nEla gosta das histórias com você, afinal de contas.
E aí, Rush. Como estão as coisas?\nEstava contando para minha irmã sobre nossas viagens,\ne parece que ela se interessou pelo General Blocter...\nTenho certeza que ele é um bom sujeito, mas sendo seu\nirmão, não estou certo de como me sinto sobre isso...
Sinto muito, querido, ainda estou abrindo a loja.\nEstá demorando muito o retorno dos meus fornecedores..\nAhh, não é fácil manter um estoque em uma área rural\ncomo essa aqui!

Oho, o que te traz a esse canto distante da cidade?\nBenvindo ao\nBairro de Virtus\n, garoto.\nSe está à procura de alguma coisa\nou alguém,\npasse\nlá na\ntaverna\n. Certamente vai encontrar alguém ali\ndisposto a te ajudar.

Não pensei que um único homem poderia jogar Athlum em\ntodo esse caos... É exatamente isso o que fez aquele\ntal Conquistador.\nAté mesmo os valentões, que costumam espreitar nos\nbecos, saíram correndo aos gritos quando o viram!\n...Eu acho que fiz a mesma coisa.
Se caminhar pelas ruas daqui, tudo que vai ouvir são\nvozes preocupadas. E as pessoas dizem que é porque o\nCoração Valeriano se foi... O que isso quer dizer!?\nSerá que somos tão supersticiosos que não\nconseguimos ter nenhuma confiança em nós mesmos?\nNossa força não vem de nenhum Remanescente,\nela\nvem de nós mesmos!\n...Bem, pelo menos é isso que o taverneiro\nestava dizendo mais cedo.
Athlum independente... Não sei se isso vai mudar\nalguma coisa na minha vida, mas se todo mundo está\ncomemorando, eu também deveria fazer o mesmo, certo?
Lorde David vai desafiar o Conquistador!?\nBem...Acho que um idiota como ele não pode ficar livre\npara fazer tudo o que quiser, ele precisa ser derrotado\ne preso para sempre! Vou estar torcendo por vocês!
Historicamente, tem havido muita atividade tectônica\npor aqui. É por isso que existem tantas cavernas na\nregião.\nÉ somente graças ao Coração Valeriano que o chão\nembaixo de Athlum se mantém estável.
[[Mensagem do 2º Nível]]
[[Mensagem do 3º Nível]]
Dizem que o exército do Conquistador vem do oriente\ndistante, de uma terra chamada Veyriel.\nÉ um lugar tão remoto que eles nem mesmo tem cidades,\napenas amontoados de cabanas.\nQuem diria que alguém de um lugar como esse seria capaz\nde derrotar Athlum tão facilmente...\nQue tipo de pessoa é esse Conquistador, enfim?
Agora que o Duque Ghor se tornou presidente do\nConselho, a busca por novos Remanescentes vem\nacontecendo com força total.\nGraças a ele, as pessoas estão descobrindo\num monte de lugares ainda não explorados.
Agora ele vai para a costa ao norte!\nEu sabia que tudo estava conectado de alguma forma...\nSobre o que estou falando? Siebenbur, o que mais?\nEles encontraram uma outra entrada na costa\nao norte.
Parece que o Duque Qubine reconheceu a independência\nde Athlum. Que tipo de maquinações aconteceram\npor detrás dos panos para fazê-lo concordar?
Hmm... É verdade que se o Conquistador fosse deixado\npor conta própria, certamente causaria problemas, ou\npossivelmente faria algo terrível...\nMas ele tem o apoio do Imperador. Eu espero\nque isso não se volte contra nós mesmos...
O Remanescente de Lorde David, o Gae Bolg, é\nincrivelmente poderoso...mas usá-lo vem ao custo\nda vida da pessoa ao qual ele está ligado.\nNós provavelmente não notamos isso até agora, mas\ntalvez o uso dos Remanescentes tenha um certo preço...
[[Mensagem do 2º Nível]]
Todos nessa cidade, uma vez ou outra, experimentaram\no sofrimento. Mas agora, sem o Coração Valeriano, tudo\nparece muito pior.\nTalvez...talvez estejamos sendo testados\npara ver se podemos viver\nsem Remanescentes.\nNão sei o que o futuro nos reserva, mas\npelo menos temos de tentar, você não acha?
Então, parece que o Conselho nomeou pessoas para\nencontrar novos Remanescentes para substituir aqueles\nroubados pelo Conquistador. E agora que todo mundo sabe\no que o Gwayn fez a Nagapur...\nTolos! Eles estão tentando repetir aquela cena\nem todo o continente?
Uma Athlum livre... Ainda não consigo acreditar nisso.\nNo entanto, a parte difícil ainda está por vir...\nPara o bem ou para o mal, vamos todos ter de nos\npreparar e trabalharmos juntos.
Porque a única coisa que as pessoas conseguem\nconcordar é com a guerra?\nQuero acreditar em Lorde David, quero mesmo, mas\nacho que ele está tomando uma decisão errada...
Olá. É melhor ficar atento nessa parte da cidade...\nVocê pode encontrar pessoas que não tão legais com\ngarotos que parecem ter um pouco de dinheiro.\nClaro, Lorde David expulsou da cidade os piores tipos.\nMas ainda assim você precisa ter muito cuidado.
Estão dizendo pelas ruas que as pessoas estão se\nescondendo em suas casas porque um tal Conquistador\nestá tocando o terror nas cidades, por todo lado.\nMas que covardes e medrosos! Se aquele loirão pateta\ntentar vir até Athlum, vou chutar sua bunda\ncom tanta força que ele vai sentir na frente!
*soluço* ... *fungado*\nSenhora Emma...\nE-ela se sacrificou para que pudéssemos fugir...\nE-e então, o Coração Valeriano veio chicoteando do céu.\nE-eu não sei mais o que aconteceu...
Droga, não é porque o Coração Valeriano se foi que a\ncidade está condenada, nas trevas, destruída\nou sei lá o quê.\nLorde David já está em busca de um novo símbolo, certo?\nEntão, estava também pensando em ajudar a encontrar um.\nEntão ninguém teria porque se preocupar.\nEu poderia encontrar um novo Remanescente em um minuto!
Independência? Quer dizer...\n...Ohh...quer dizer que aqueles chatos de Celapaleis\nnão vão mais poder dar palpites sobre o que fazemos!\nSiiiim, toma essa, seus idiotas!
O Conquistador, hã? Chute a sua bunda quantas vezes\npuder, até ele chorar!
Os soldados que foram até as Ruínas de Robélia ainda\nnão voltaram...Se a Senhora Emma pudesse investigar...
Hmm? Rosto aborrecido, roupas extravagantes, ombros\ncaídos... Você aí, você não é Rush Sykes?\nSim...por quê?\nVocê está enganado, velho.

Ha ha ha, você está sendo malandro como sempre!\nTrago uma mensagem de Lorde David. Ele solicita que\nvocê vá ao\ncastelo\nassim que possível.
Sinto muito, querido, a loja ainda não está aberta.\nQueria ter algo para nossas tropas antes do combate...\n*suspiro* Os melhores planos nem sempre dão certo.
O que diabos você quer?\nNão sabe quem sou? Se não tem nada para me propor\nentão é melhor me deixar em paz.
Você já ouviu falar de Loki, o bandido que vive\nna montanha? Aquele do qual sua mãe falava,\njunto do bicho papão? Esse sou eu.\nSou escória, tá sabendo? Um cara mau. Se te verem\nfalando comigo, sua preciosa reputação será arruinada.\nEntendeu? Fique bem longe de mim.
Eu sou Loki, o bandido da montanha, entendeu?\nUm cara mau. Se dá valor naquilo que é importante\npara você, é melhor ficar longe.
No dia em que nasci, um terrível desastre assolou\nminha vila. O lugar todo foi praticamente destruído.\nTodos na cidade disseram que eu era amaldiçoado...\nque eu havia trazido má sorte. Eu era só um bebê,\ne eles me odiavam.\nEntão eu cresci, e passei a odiar eles também,\ncada pessoa daquele maldito lugar.\nBrigava com eles, amaldiçoava-os... No final,\nnem mesmo minha própria mãe me suportava...
Desde o dia em que nasci, as pessoas da minha vila\ndisseram que eu era amaldiçoado. Cada maldita pessoa\nnaquela vila me odiava. Até mesmo minha própria mãe...
Então deixei a vila, e comecei a fazer fama\ncomo o temível bandido Loki.\nMatando pessoas, caçando, odiando elas...\nTodos os dias, era isso que fazia. E era tudo o que\nqueria fazer.\nAté que um dia encontrei essa garota...\nE isso mudou tudo.\nEstava terminando um trabalho\nna sua casa\nquando\npercebi que havia uma garotinha ali. Não estava\nde brincadeira, e puxei minha faca.\nEu esperava que ela fosse começar a gritar e chorar,\nmas ela olhou para mim e disse olá,\ntoda alegre.\nDisse que só queria conversar...que só queria ser minha\namiga. Acontece que a garota era cega.\nÉ claro, não acreditei de início. Pensei que ela fosse\ncomo o resto, tentando me enganar. Mas acontece\nque ela só queria um amigo.\nEra a primeira vez que algo assim acontecia comigo...\na primeira vez que topei com alguém que estava\nrealmente feliz em me conhecer. A primeira e única...\nQuer dizer, droga, meu próprios pais não queriam nada\ncomigo, e essa garotinha,\nchamada Reya,\nqueria que fôssemos amigos.\nNão é uma viagem...\n...É sério, ela me salvou.\nQuem sabe o que eu poderia me tornar...\nÉ por isso que todo esse tempo estive procurando algo\nque possa consertar sua visão. Ela fez muito por mim.\nEu queria ao menos tentar retribuir o que ela fez.
Não houve uma única pessoa no mundo que quis alguma\ncoisa comigo, além da Reya. Por isso estive procurando\nalgo que possa consertar sua visão...Devo isso a ela.
Acho que te devo uma, Rush.\nMeus olhos funcionam bem, mas meu coração não deixava\neles verem nada. Eu só conseguia ver dor e escuridão.\nFoi graças à Reya que fui capaz de mandar um pouco\ndaquela escuridão embora...ela e...\nHuh. É engraçado como é fácil fazer amigos.\nVocê só tem de se abrir um pouco.
Você de novo. E aí?

As armas são o espelho da alma. Assim, uma poderosa\nespada nas mãos de um guerreiro inexperiente\nnunca alcançará seu verdadeiro potencial.\nLembre-se, meu jovem, as armas não são apenas ferramentas\npara aprimorar habilidades. Elas também servem para\nfortalecer sua vontade.
Parece que você finalmente começou a descobrir o\nverdadeiro valor das artes, meu jovem. Não se descuide.
Ouvi dizer que um jovem comandante de Athlum\nenfrentou o guerreiro Yerva em combate singular.\nQuem diria que alguém aqui teria esse poder...\nEu gostaria de cruzar espadas com ele também.
A independência de Athlum, hã?\nSe pudesse escolher, iria preferir que os Lordes\nse unissem para trazer a paz ao mundo.\nSim, sei que depois disso eu ficaria sem trabalho...
A batalha final com o Conquistador...\nParece que esse assunto não vai chegar ao fim\naté que ele seja derrotado.\nSeja muito astuto e planeje suas ações\ncom muito cuidado.\nO caminho para a vitória se abrirá para você.

Isso é uma\nguilda\n. Sinto muito, a pessoa no comando\nnão está aqui agora.\nTente mais tarde.
O que é isso? Não me diga que um garoto como você\nestá querendo pegar algumas tarefas da guilda!\nVocê é mais verde que um pedaço de brócolis!\nGahahah, impossível, você nunca conseguiria!\nElas não são para garotos que vão apanhar de\nmonstros e vão voltar para casa chamando a mamãe!\nPoupe sua viagem e volte para casa.
Tarefas da guilda?\nTem de todo tipo...de coisas simples\na trabalhos bem cabeludos.\nEhh, se você tiver tempo, então dê uma olhada,\ntalvez pegue uma ou duas, então vai ver.
Ei, garoto, você está sabendo? Alguns dos melhores\nguerreiros da região fundaram sua própria\nguilda.\nDizem que há uma entrada secreta na parte\nde trás da Honra do Guerreiro, ou coisa parecida...
Independência? Sim, sim, isso é ótimo, tenho certeza.\nMas estou mais interessado nas tarefas da guilda.
O Conquistador? Oh sim, ele é um encrenqueiro, sim.\nMas estou mais interessado nas tarefas da guilda.
O que há de errado, novato, está perdido? Isso é uma\n guilda, um lugar onde guerreiros veteranos se reúnem.\nNão é lugar para garotos de cara limpa que mal\nsabem como segurar uma espada. Vá para casa\njogar beisebol ou coisa parecida.
Se está procurando algo para fazer, então a\nguilda é o lugar certo.\nE não estou falando de trabalho de caridade. Você pode\nreceber uma bela recompensa se escolher a tarefa certa.\nBem, eles também ganham com isso,\nmas você recebe pelo trabalho.

Bem-vindo, viajante, à Honra do Guerreiro!\nEntre e fique à vontade.
Bem-vindo à Honra do Guerreiro! ...O-lá, você não tem\num rosto familiar. E acredite em mim, eu me lembraria\n de...um rosto como o seu.
Você deve ser novo em Athlum, hmm?\nEntão quero que saiba, se tiver qualqueeer pergunta,\nvenha diretamente até mim. Posso ser sua\num... guia pessoal.\n...
O quêêê, você está tentando encontrar Lorde David?\nBem, ele recebe visitantes no 
Castelo de Athlum\n, que está mais ao centro\nda cidade.\nDito isso, não acho que qualquer um possa chegar lá e\nconseguir uma audiência.
Mas é claro, para um lindinho como você, ele\npode fazer uma exceção...
Cabelo loiro brilhante, um rosto bem-feito...
Lorde David é certamente uma figura impressionante.\nVocê não consegue parar de olhar para ele...
Quero dizer, admirá-lo...
Bem-vindo de volta, lindinho!\nUma garota de aparência misteriosa tem vindo aqui\nultimamente. Ela é bem impressionante, também...
Não pode ser comparada comigo, é claro!
Me diz, você conhece\nCelapaleis\n, certo?\nÉ o estado soberano de Athlum.\nEstá ao noroeste, no limite do continente.
Eu vou a Celapaleis de vez em quando para\ndar uma olhada em novos acessórios.\nVocê deveria visitar, querido. Você iria amar.
Ah, olá, querido. Olha, não quero que você fique\nassustado, mas aqueles soldados bem ali\nestão procurando por você...\nVocê não andou fazendo nada de errado\naqui em Athlum, andou? Você não é um garotinho!\nVocê me lembra de mim mesma...
Mas que cara é essa?\nFranzir as sobrancelhas assim traz má sorte,\nsabe disso.
Olá, querido. Aqueles guardas estão procurando por\nvocê novamente. É alguma coisa sobre eles terem uma\nmensagem do Lorde David...\nOlha, minha taverna atende muitos guardas de Athlum,\nmas não gosto que venham aqui estando de serviço,\nentão vá falar com eles, ok?
Não posso acreditar nisso...uma mensagem do\nmeu adorado Marquês\npara você? Será que posso saber o que há\nentre vocês dois!?\nAah! Estou com tanta inveja!
Você está indo, não está? Para Wyrmskeep...para\nNagapur.\nDuke Hermeien é um homem frio e sem piedade.\nTenha cuidado com ele, Rush.\nE se você encontrar aquele bastardo do Conquistador...\nFaça ele pagar pela morte da Senhora Emma!
Ah, você está atrasado! Estive te esperando por\nséculos... Lorde David esteve procurando você, também.\nParece que o Duque Ghor precisa dele para algo...\nEntão, é melhor você se dirigir ao castelo.
Ah, acho que agora é Presidente Ghor, huh.\nDizem que ele é um líder valente\ne varonil.\nPelo menos parece ser um bom homem para\nliderar o continente depois de tudo que aconteceu.
Independência... Isso soa bem, não?\nSe ao menos papai tivesse uma chance de ouvir isso...
Então, você está indo enfrentar o Conquistador...\nÉ melhor voltar a salvo, certo, destruidor?\nPorque se não fizer isso...vai ouvir de mim!
Ah garoto, outra noite, o taverneiro ficou em um\nestado lamentável e foi dar uma volta perto das\nruínas de Robélia.\nE então, um sujeito que parecia seu irmão gêmeo\nsurgiu do nada e o atacou!\n...Pelo menos, isso é o que ele diz.\nEu não sei, ele poderia simplesmente ter desmaiado e\nsonhado com essa coisa toda.
Ao leste da cidade está um extenso trecho de campos,\na Planície Yamarn.\nO lugar tem sido um campo de batalha por anos e\nanos. As pessoas têm lutado contra todos, desde hordas\nde monstros até o exército de Ghor.\nFalando sério, se um Zé Ninguém como eu tivesse de\ncolocar os pés naquele lugar, estaria voltando\ndentro de um caixão de pinho!
Celapaleis? Ah, é a grande cidade mais\nao norte. É a capital soberana de Athlum.\nGraças a eles nosso exército não pode sequer dar um\npulo sem perguntar a altura para aquele garoto Qubine.
Você já esteve na Praça da Cidade?\nÉ chocante, não é? O Coração Valeriano\nse foi, como se nunca tivesse estado ali!\nAquele Remanescente era muito mais que um símbolo\nda cidade. A praça toda é um lugar de\nincontáveis memórias para cada habitante de Athlum...\nDroga. Taverneiro, você pode preparar algo\nbem forte para mim?
Esse novo presidente do Conselho, Ghor, é aquele que\nvive naquela fortaleza em condiçoes precárias, não é?\nQuando ele entrou no escritório, pensei que tinha só\nmúsculos e nada de cérebro, mas ele está fazendo bem\no trabalho de colocar as coisas sob controle. E agora,\nestá até mesmo enviando gente para encontrar para nós\nnovos Remanescentes? Esse sim é um bom sujeito!
Aparentemente foi o Duque de Ghor que sugeriu para\nQubine que Athlum estava pronto para independência.\nAinda que tenhamos sido inimigos, ele reconhece nosso\nvalor... Esse é um homem de verdade, esse Ghor.
Nós vamos definitivamente acabar com o Conquistador.\nEu acredito nisso com tanta força que vou me sentar\nbem ali e tomar outra dose.
"Em um tempo tomado pelo perigo, até mesmo a própria\nterra tremia diante de sua ferocidade, até que um dia\ntodos demônios foram acalmados por uma lâmina gigante,\nenviada pelos deuses..." Isso é o que diz a lenda do\nCoração Valeriano. Quando eu era jovem, meu pai me\ncontava a história dia após dia.\nMas ele costumava terminá-la com alguma coisa como\n"é melhor você ser bom, ou o Coração Valeriano\nvai pegar você."
Essa história sobre o Coração Valeriano era só\num monte de mentiras!\nO Conquistador... Ele fez tantas coisas ruins,\nele\naté mesmo matou a Senhora Emma\nonde está a punição\npara isso, hã?\nE eu acreditava no Coração Valeriano! Eu realmente\nacreditei, durante todo esse tempo... Maldito seja!
Athlum independente...? Não me leve a mal, não estou\ntentando fazer chover na festa de ninguém, mas... Não\nsei. Eu simplesmente não consigo pensar nisso agora.
Dessa vez...dessa vez o Conquistador vai pagar pelo\nque fez! E nós poderemos finalmente descobrir\no que aconteceu com o Coração Valeriano!
Parece que começaram a reconstruir as Minas de Numor.\nEles ainda têm de acabar com os monstros que vivem ali\nentão vai demorar um pouco antes da grande reabertura.\nVai ser bastante difícil não poder mais minerar ali...\nOuvi dizer que eles finalmente fizeram o elevador\nter acesso ao nível mais baixo.\nEsse é o melhor momento para explorar as minas.
Quem sou eu?\nSou um caçador de monstros.\nDo que você precisa?\nMe fale dos monstros.\nNada não! Boa caçada.
Muito bem, parceiro.\nVocê tem tempo para sentar e conversar?\nNão posso caçar monstros, você sabe!\nNão estou com pressa.\nAh, ok. Mais tarde, então.
Ahh, que pena.\nBem, volte aqui quando tiver um tempo.
Tudo bem então!\nAqui vamos nós.
Bem, quando você encontrar um monstro, dê uma boa\nolhada nele. Se você prestar atenção, vai\npoder dizer se está pronto para o combate, ou não.
Mantenha distância, no entanto; se você puder chegar\nperto sem que ele o veja, tanto melhor.\nEsse é um truque de caçador, sabe?
Em seguida vem a batalha! Agora, quando você entra\nem uma luta contra um monstro, você precisa\nter cuidado porque pode acabar\ntendo de lutar com ele e seus amigos, também.
Se está caçando por esporte, esse é um cavalo de\noutra cor. Se quer recompensas, você vai precisar\npegar quantos monstros puder, todos ao mesmo tempo.\nMas não fique brincando, fazendo coisas engraçadas\nquando eles estiverem por perto. Mesmo que pareçam\ncalmos, você nunca sabe o que uma besta vai fazer, hã?
Lembre-se, a prática leva à perfeição. Tenha mais\nconfiança em si mesmo e tudo vai dar certo.
Quem sou eu?\nSou um caçador de mons...\nsabe?\nAh, é você de novo.\nEu acho que você quer saber sobre monstros, hã?\nÉ uma longa conversa, você tem tempo dessa vez?\nSou todo ouvidos.\nAhh, sinto muito, tenho de ir.
Bem...isso é suficiente por agora, hmm? Se te conto\nmais segredos você vai me deixar sem trabalho! O resto\nvocê vai ter de descobrir por si mesmo. Boa caçada!
Hmm? Cara de aborrecido, roupa extravagante, ombros\ncaídos...Você aí, você não é Rush Sykes, é?\nSim...por quê?\nVocê está enganado, velho.
O quêêê? Garoto imprudente...\nLorde David fez uma convocação...ele disse que\nprecisava falar com você sobre alguma coisa. Corra\npara o castelo.
*bufando* Se fingir de tolo não vai levar você\na lugar algum, se é que está\nbrincando.\nLorde David fez uma convocação...ele disse que\nprecisava falar com você sobre alguma coisa.\nRápido para o castelo
Humm? Sim...esse rosto, essas roupas...\nVocê é Rush Sykes, correto?\nSim, sou Rush!\nNão, eu sou, uh, outra pessoa.
Foi o que pensei! Tenho uma mensagem para você,\ndo Lorde David. Ele disse que encontrou um bom lugar\npara iniciar a coleta de informações, e\nque você deveria ir para o\ncastelo\npara mais detalhes.\nEntendeu?
Hahaha, você é um péssimo ator, garoto.\nNão se preocupe,\nvocê não está encrencado...pelo menos, não conosco.\nLorde David está convocando você.\nAparentemente ele encontrou um bom lugar para iniciar\na coleta de informações, então ele quer que vá\nao\ncastelo\npara poder compartilhar isso com você. Não o deixe\nesperando, ok, garoto? Senão você pode acabar mesmo\ntendo problemas com a gente... Estou só brincando!
Ohh! Essa figura valente...\nVocê deve ser Rush Sykes, não é mesmo?\nO primeiro e único!\nDepende de quem está perguntando.
Muito bem!\nDavid, Marquês de Athlum, requisita sua presença\nno\nCastelo de Athlum\nassim que puder.
Ha ha ha, você está sendo malandro como sempre!\nEu trago uma mensagem de Lorde David. Ele solicita\nque você venha ao\ncastelo\nassim que possível.
Ah, é você.\nA única razão pela qual aceitei viajar com você\nfoi pelo dinheiro. Se você quer ficar de conversa, vá\nprocurar outra pessoa. Pare de me fazer perder tempo.
Você de novo?\nQual parte do "não fale comigo" você não entendeu?\nEu sei que pensa que sou só uma ambiciosa que só pensa\nem dinheiro, mas não me importo.\nSó me importo com o que é dourado e brilhante.\nPor quê?\nNão acho que seja da sua conta. Se quer realmente\nsaber...vai ter de pagar por isso.
Será que preciso de uma placa dizendo "Cale a boca"?\nOlha, não quero conversar. Quero ganhar dinheiro.\nSe você não quer me ajudar com isso, caia fora.
Quanto tempo você está planejando ficar aí sentado?\nNão tenho tempo para ficar vadiando e me coçando\ncomo você.\nDeve haver algum trabalha para pegarmos... Patrulhar,\ncaçar monstros, até mesmo fazer uma busca... Jogue\num osso para mim aqui!\nUrgh, tenho certeza de que as Damas estão atrás de\ndinheiro enquanto falamos... Elas sabem o que é\nprecisar de um lugar para viver e comida para comer...\nEu não consigo entender pessoas como vocês.
Sério, você ainda está aí sentado sem fazer nada?\nNão me importo se você é preguiçoso, mas tempo é\ndinheiro, será que podemos voltar ao trabalho?
Se estou cansada?\nDessa droga? Não me faça rir.\nTente viver sem nada, sempre correndo, sem poder\nparar por um minuto sequer sem ter de olhar\npara trás\n...Não importa.\nVocê pode\nvocê pode não mencionar que eu disse algo\nassim? Droga, acho que estou cansada de verdade...\nEi, garoto...\nSeu nome é "Sykes", certo? Então seus pais são mesmo\naqueles pesquisadores famosos, não?\nEles nunca te contaram nada sobre os projetos secretos\ne clandestinos da Academia?\n...\nBah, só de olhar para a sua cara posso ver que você \nnão sabe de nada. Seja como for, não perca seus dois\nneurônios se preocupando com isso.\nEu estou com dor de cabeça...\nMe deixe sozinha por um tempo.
Olha só.\nPor favor, me deixe sozinha por um tempo.
Rush... Você de novo.\nTudo bem, você quer conversar? Vamos conversar.\nMas se vai me fazer falar, é bom que esteja ouvindo.\nVou contar a você sobre as Damas Sangrentas...\nNós começamos vinculadas ao Terceiro Comitê\nda Academia.\nComo você provavelmente já sabe, elas fazem o trabalho\nsujo para os outros cientistas... Nós ajudamos em\nmuitos dos seus "testes".\nHeh, "testes" soa muito agradável comparado às coisas\nque fizemos... Mas é claro, nunca nos opusemos a elas.\nNós "Damas" não éramos nenhumas senhorinhas.\nEstávamos mais para as cadelas mais rudes que você já\nencontrou. Algumas de nós até mesmo pensava que éramos\nsortudas por ter um nome tão doce. Mas...\neventualmente, nossa sorte foi embora. Um dia\ndescobrimos que éramos as cobaias nos seus últimos\ntestes para fundir uma pessoa a um Remanescente...\nDesde então tenho de comer como um poço sem fundo,\nporque se não tiver várias vezes os nutrientes\nde um mitra, vou morrer.\nPatético, hã.\n...\nPorque infernos você está me olhando com essa cara?\nSe eu quisesse sua piedade teria inventado alguma\nhistória boba sobre a morte do meu peixinho dourado ou\numa besteira desse tipo. Eu apenas...\napenas senti vontade de dizer tudo isso para você.\nO que está feito está feito. Não adianta lamentar.\nÉ melhor viver a vida enquanto ainda podemos.
Ei, garoto.\nPara onde nós vamos agora?\nCertifique-se de que paguem bem, hã?
Nada interessante tem acontecido recentemente...
Você conhece o Barão Nielsen de Celapaleis? Parece\nque sua esposa desapareceu. ...É claro, esses dois são\nfamosos por não se darem bem, então não é novidade.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Mas que desculpa vergonhosa uma esposa!\nVocê sabe, eu saberia como cuidar apropriadamente\nde um homem...
Eu não quero acreditar nisso, mas parece que há\numa mulher doida planejando assassinar\no Duque Qubine...
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Pobre Lorde Qubine...ele é tão adorável para ter de\nse preocupar com coisas tão ridículas!
Então, a princesa do deserto tem escapado com\nbastante frequência para se encontrar com um garoto\ncom quem anda enamorada. Isso parece perigoso...
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Eu sei, certo? Qualquer um poderia se aproveitar de\numa princesa indefesa como ela... Eu espero\nque ela não tenha se envolvido com más companhias!
Ei!\nEntão, a princesa do deserto fugiu com seu amado!
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:0Aughhh... Aquele Lorde Paris é muito gentil.\nEu tinha certeza que ele era dos nossos... *suspiro*
Parece que as relações entre Balterossa e Royotia não\nestão boas. As famílias dos soldados estão preocupadas\nporque os exércitos estão sendo mobilizados...
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Argh, mas que crise! A guerra não vai consertar nada.\nE se o rosto de Paris receber uma cicatriz...\nAah, estou ficando chocada só de pensar nisso!
Eu sei, certo?
Então, parece que o Imperador aprisionou algo no\ngrande pântano... O problema é que a barreira caiu.\nPoderia ser a entrada para algum outro mundo...
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Todo mundo tem coisas no seu passado que gostaria de\ndeixar esquecido. Eu nem consigo contar quantas coisas\neu gostaria de esquecer...
Há uma Donzela do Bosque que tem um vínculo tão\nforte com seu Cavaleiro que pode ver pelos seus olhos\ne ouvir pelos seus ouvidos, ou algo assim.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Eu também tenho a alma de donzela pura e inocente.\nNascida de novo, é claro.
As Donzelas do Bosque e a Ordem de Melphina estão\nse mobilizando... Parece que algo aconteceu com\na Folha Caída em Crookfen.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Eu me pergunto sobre o que está acontecendo.\nEu sei, vamos verificar!
E-e o que fazemos com a taverna?
Está quase na hora da Festa Cósmica, huh. Mas parece\nque a Donzela Cósmica ainda não chegou a Nagapur.\nTalvez tenha acontecido alguma coisa com ela...
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Você não pode ter uma Festa Cósmica sem uma Donzela\nCósmica! Como tenho espírito nobre, vou me voluntariar\npara tomar o seu lugar...Mas isso vai custar a eles.
Então a Donzela Cósmica conseguiu, e eles começaram a\nFesta Cósmica. Geralmente a cerimônia tem um monte de\nbesteira, mas dessa vez foi interrompida por monstros.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Ouvi dizer que a Festa Cósmica é tão romântica...\ncomo algo saído de um conto de fadas.\n...Ahhh, eu queeeero ir!
Ouvi dizer que uma garota antiquada está querendo\ncontratar um guarda-costas. Ela pode ser encontrada\nna taverna perto do canal.

O que ela está fazendo para precisar de tanta\nproteção? Quero dizer, você não me vê cercada de caras\nmusculosos... Não por dinheiro, pelo menos.
Você não está por dentro de antiguidades, está?\nAparentemente muitos tesouros dos Reinos Antigos estão\nindo parar no mercado negro.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Alguém está roubando tesouros? Isso quer dizer que\nalguém poderia estar vindo atrás do meu precioso!\nEu nunca permitirei que ele vá parar no mercado negro!
Tenho certeza de que o seu será dispensado.
Um sujeito está procurando por essas três pedras que\nsão realmente importantes para o deserto.\nHistoricamente significante, ou coisa parecida.

Um sujeito interessado em magia antiga está procurando\npessoas para ajudá-lo em sua pesquisa. Parece que ele\nestá prestes a descobrir algum grande mistério.

Magia antiga, hã? Esse sujeito deve ser inteligente.\nTalvez eu possa me voluntariar...deve ter algo para se\ndizer a um homem que sabe o que está fazendo.
Então, algumas pessoas estão dizendo que é o fim do\nmundo por causa de um monstro aí. Parece que ele foi\naprisionado pelo Imperador, e agora está de volta...

Mais uma razão para semear o amor enquanto dá, hã?
Um homem com amnésia anda vagando pelas cidades\ndo deserto, procurando por alguma coisa que possa\ntrazer de volta sua memória.

Esperando por você...?\nAcho que coisas estranhas estão acontecendo.
Há uma estátua nas Ruínas de Robélia que pode ajudar\na encontrar qualquer pessoa no mundo, não importa onde\nesteja. Um garoto procurando pela sua irmã quer ela...

(Com quem ele quer...\nNah, eu nem quero saber.)
Uma coisa estranha\nvem aterrorizando Celapaleis.\nEla está realmente assustando as pessoas de lá.

Há um assassino à solta na capital!
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Isso é terrível! Eu espero que encontrem o assassino\ne o levem à justiça logo! Aah, e todas\nminhas lojas favoritas estão lá...
Argh, não raspe suas unhas na louça!

Parece que um qsiti albino está em busca de um livro\nmágico. As pessoas dizem que ele parece familiar, mas\nninguém se lembra de onde.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Um qsiti albino? Isso é bem raro. Se o trouxer para\ntrabalhar aqui, acho que teremos muito mais clientes.
Isso é um bar, não uma casa de shows...
Duas garotas gêmeas começaram a trabalhar como\nmercenárias recentemente...muito boas. Uma delas\nparece ser bem legal,\ntanto na aparência quanto na atitude.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.

Um velho guerreiro está atravessando o Grande Oceano\nde Areia, à procura de uma espada especial.

Os guardas de Ghor juraram seguir o seu comando\nenquanto viverem.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Todos dizem que o Duque de Ghor é um homem corajoso e\nhonrado. Talvez eu possa deixar tudo e\nsegui-lo enquanto viver, também...
E quanto a permanecer fiel a essa taverna!?
Não há família no mundo tão dedicada como os\nHoneywells. Se você os tem ao seu lado,\npode conseguir qualquer coisa.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Certamente acredito nisso! Respeito demais a Senhora\nEmma. Se as garotas de Athlum seguissem seu exemplo,\nseriam as lindas e fortes do mundo.
Sim! Eu admiro ela também.
Então, esse boato é bastante suculento...\nParece que o General Torgal encontrou alguém do seu\npassado em Royotia...

Athlum tem passado por momentos difíceis, e as\npessoas estão preocupadas com a nova matriarca do\nclã Honeywell porque ela é muito jovem.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Ela ficará bem. Ela é como uma cópia carbono da\nSenhora Emma quando tinha aquela idade.
Isso! Eu não acho que vamos ter de nos preocupar!
Recentemente tem havido rumores sobre os interesses\nromânticos do Lorde David...ou falta deles. Ele nunca\nesteve conectado a alguém.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Mas é claro! Lorde David está se concentrando nas\ncoisas importantes de governar um país. ...Além disso,\nele está se guardando para mim. Sinto muito, garotas!
A antiga chefe da Academia tem sido vista em tavernas\nao longo do continente. Acho que faz sentido\nela querer afogar suas dores depois do que aconteceu.

Bebendo para esquecer... Ela realmente acredita que\nisso vai tornar as coisas melhores?
Dr. Sykes tem sido visto entrando e saindo bastante\ndo castelo. Será que fez alguma grande descoberta?

Q-quanto tempo essa história deve ter!?
Um exército de monstros apareceu no Grande Oceano\nde Areia. Eles são tão poderosos que todos em\nBalterossa estão totalmente desesperados...
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Apenas aqueles que conheceram o desespero conhecem o\nverdadeiro significado da esperança... Então, todos\ndeveriam ter a chance de prová-lo ao menos uma vez!
Bem, essa poderia ser sua primeira e última chance!
De acordo com antigos historiadores, há alguma coisa\nperigosa o suficiente para destruir cidades inteiras\naprisionada dentro do vulcão...
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Que besteira. Meu amor por Lorde David é suficiente\npara arrasar toda a cidade de Athlum!

...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.

Você...você está falando sério!?

Pobrezinho... Todo mundo já experimentou a solidão.\nVocê não é o único que já sentiu vontade de chorar...
N-não, isso não é o que eu queria dizer...
Muito tempo atrás, havia um heroi famoso\nque vivia no Grande Oceano de Areia.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Alguém tão famoso deve ter sido um homem simplesmente\nincrível... Se apenas eu tivesse nascido algumas\ncentenas de anos mais cedo! *suspiro*
Então, eu estava caminhando pela Praça da Cidade e\nouvi esse sujeito dizendo "você tem de acreditar em\nmim! Se você olhar os pilares no Grande Oceano de\nAreia, então...v-vó v-vó!"
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
"V-v-vovó," ele disse!? Mas que rude! Não estou nem\nperto de alcançar meu auge, aquele pequeno atrevido\nooh!
Um cientista velho e louco tem vagado ao redor de\nMelphina. Se você for lá, é melhor ficar\nlonge, ele está olhando as pessoas de forma estranha.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Hmm? Como as olha, me pergunto? Se é com o olhar de\num coração ferido, então ele poderia vir aqui para\nse recuperar no nosso ambiente amigável e acolhedor!
Mas é claro\ndesde que ele pague pela sua comida e bebida\ndepois!
Dizem que o café de Baaluk está infestado com\ninsetos...eles seguiram o seu dono desde o\ndeserto.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Ew, ew, ew! Urgh, eu odeio insetos!
Tenho certeza que ainda não te encontraram, também...
Nagapur tem se tornado cada vez mais insegura.\nRecentemente um monte de garotos desapareceu...
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Bom Deus! Será que eles foram sequestrados? Melhor\nser mais cuidadosa também.
Aventureiros começaram a negociar diferentes\nmercadorias que encontram em suas viagens. Royotia\né o lugar principal dessa nova moda.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Mas que triste. Meus maiores tesouros são os\nsentimentos secretos que guardo no meu peito. Mas eu\nnão negociaria eles por nada nesse mundo!
...Certo.
Os mercadores de Royotia estão ficando frustrados com\nBalterossa...eles controlam todas suas rotas comerciais.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Sim, as jóias de Royotia são incrivelmente caras. Eu\nrealmente gostaria de comprar algumas, mas não tenho\ndinheiro. Talvez se cortar o pagamento do pessoal...
O-o quê!? De jeito nenhum!
Um mercenário yama está procurando por um parceiro.\nPoderia ser uma boa maneira de conseguir dinheiro.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Aah, deve ser ele bem ali, não? Mas que homem forte\ne robusto... Mm, se eu fosse você, querido,\ndefinitivamente seria seu parceiro.
Um sujeito com problemas de personalidade apareceu em\nCelapaleis. Ele às vezes é gentil, mas de repente\ncomeça a insultar as pessoas, de uma hora para outra.
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Mmm, por alguma razão eu sempre me senti atraída por\nhomens bipolares como esse. Acho que eles acendem meus\ninstintos maternais...
"Maternais"...?
Há um qsiti que está indo em lugares cheios de gente\npara ficar no caminho de todo mundo, arranjando briga\ncom as pessoas que tropeçam nele. Que aborrecimento...
...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.
Ah! Já encontrei esse sujeito antes...literalmente.\nSe ele alguma vez vier aqui, a única coisa que vou\nservir a ele é um bofetão na cara!\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1Então, parece que há uma garota misteriosa procurando\npor alguém para ajudá-la em algo. Ela parecia\nter algo importante para perguntar.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:0Eu também tenho uma coisa para perguntar
...\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1O quê?\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1Eu contei sobre a mulher misteriosa de antes, certo?\nParece que ela continua esperando por algo realmente\nimportante. Ouvi dizer que ela parecia muito preocupada...\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:0Estou esperando por algo muito importante, também...\nOu alguém...\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1Você está apenas esperando por qualquer um.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1Você provavelmente as viu se esteve andando ao redor\nde Crookfen, as Damas Sangrentas, estão se reunindo.\nParece que alguma coisa grande está acontecendo...\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:0Eu uma vez quis me juntar a elas...Damas Sangrentas.\nÉ claro, naquele tempo eu era um pouco rebelde, indo\ncontra tudo e todos.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1Eu não diria que você está melhor agora...\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1Parece que os Jhana tem aparecido no Grande\nOceano de Areia. Você não acha que eles já esqueceram\nde quando foram destruídos pelo Gae Bolg...\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:0Bem... Quando você para de tentar, sua vida terminou.\nComo isso seria diferente para eles? Se você tem uma\nmeta, continue tentando até alcançá-la!\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1Isso é ótimo, mas não quando a meta é destruir\na cidade!\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1Os Falcões Prateados acabaram com um bando de Jhana.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:0Sabe, sou um membro oficial do fã clube dos Falcões\nPrateados! Seu líder sovani é tão duro e varonil...\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1Os Falcões Prateados tem estado atrás dos\nremanescentes do exército do Conquistador. Quem sabe\no que esses caras poderiam fazer...\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:0Boa sorte, Falcões! Talvez para ajudar, eu possa levar\numa bebida refrescante para aquele delicioso líder.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1M-mas quem vai cuidar da taverna?\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1Um sujeito de aparência sombria anda rondando a\ntaverna de Elysion, e deprimindo todo mundo.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1...Isso é o que contam por aqui, pelo menos.\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:0Por alguma razão, eu me sinto atraída por homens\ninquietantes e sombrios... Eu só quero descobrir todos\nseus mistérios, colocando-os nus diante de mim...\nASC_05PB_MP0:NPC:1Você parece se sentir atraída por qualquer um...

Many young women have disappeared around the\nGaslin\nCaves\n. At the same time, a seedy group has been seen\naround the\nRobelia Ruins\nWhich will you investigate first?\nThe Gaslin Caves\nThe Robelia Ruins
The caves, then?\nGo. Blocter will accompany you.
The ruins, then?\nGo. Pagus will accompany you.
Then, you're decided?\nYeah, let's check it out!\nMmm...maybe I'd better switch...
The\nGaslin Caves\nand\nRobelia Ruins\n... Perhaps a clue\nto finding Miss Irina can be found there.
I appreciate your assistance at the Gaslin Caves.\n...I see, Miss Irina was not there.\nPerhaps there is a clue to be found with the unsavory\ntypes seen gathering at the\nRobelia Castle ruins\nPagus, I leave the rest to you.

Rush, I want you to go to\nDillmoor\nalong with my\nGenerals.\nBe careful.
Ah, yes.\nRush, there was something I wanted to give you.\nEmma, if you would?
The battles from now on will only become fiercer.\nI hope that this jacket will make it a little easier\nfor you.
Thanks, Dave.
Celapaleis has sighted men matching the description\nof the ones we encountered in Dillmoor. They request\nwe look into it at once.\nOnce you've completed your preparations, let us head\nto\nBlackdale
A girl matching Irina's description was seen in\nthe clutches of the flying Remnant.\nSo, this is the true face of the men slighting Athlum...\nI will find them and make them regret this!
To reach the holy city of\nElysion\n, we must cross the\nIvory Peaks\n, a mountain range to the southeast of here.\nIt won't be an easy journey, so make sure you're\nready, Rush.
Rush, if you're ever in need of more soldiers, speak\nwith the security guard in the\nTown Square\nhe's an\narmy recruitment officer\nI'll see to it that plenty of soldiers will be available to\nyou at any time. Some of them may be...strange, to say\nthe least, but they're all good men.
The Sykes have left the main campus of the Academy\nand should be within the\nTemple of Elysion\nLet's head to the temple, Rush.
I suppose that even Emma has things she\ncannot tell me about.\n...Go on, Rush. I'll take care of your father.
The dragon castle of\nNagapur\nis to the northeast\nof Elysion, past the\nHeroic Ramparts\nHurry and get ready. I'd like to head to Nagapur\nas soon as possible.
The Conqueror's supremacy on the battlefield has been\nmore than proven. At this rate, it is only a matter of\ntime before Celapaleis falls.\nWe cannot allow that to happen! All forces\nto the\nNest of Eagles
Our true foe is the Duke of Nagapur\nWilfred\nHermeien. No more will we be puppets in his\npetty farce.\nTo\nNagapur\n...and to vengeance!
Hey, Rush. Before you leave town, make sure\nyour equipment is all set, alright?
Let's do it, Rush!
Rush! Those thugs've probably got a Remnant.\nDon't think it's gonna be a cakewalk, alright?
Rush, if you've got some extra\ncomponents\n, you\nshould take 'em down to the\nCustomization Shop\nThey can fix your equipment up good!
Ugh, I can't stand those jerks in Celapaleis. They're\nalways like "Athlum, do this! Athlum, do that!" It really\nburns me up!\nLike, this time. Sure, it's good to know bad stuff's going\non, but you don't gotta gloat when you tell it! Makes me\njust wanna\nargh!
Going to Elysion for the Congress, huh... I can't help\nbut feel nervous. You understand, I bet!\nNot like either of us would be taking part, though!
My gramps used to tell me stories about the Temple\nof Elysion... Like, how there was a place in there where\nthey used to put dead folks...\nYou...you don't think we'd have to go to that part, do\nyou? No way, right?
Oi, Rush. Don't slow Lady Emma down too much, got it?\nIf you make her angry, it won't be the monsters you'll\nhave to worry about! Gahahaha!\nDon't worry about your pop, alright? I'll take good care\nof him, no matter what!
If Athlum could get its independence, then...oh man.\nIt'd be like a dream or something... I sure hope these\ntalks with Duke Hermeien go well!
What kind of monsters are the Conqueror's army made\nof!? Sneaking around behind our backs\nwhat,\nthey've never heard of sportsmanship?\nC'mon, Rush, we gotta hurry to the Nest of Eagles\nand show those cowards what real men are made of!
When I first became one of the Four Generals,\nLady Emma would bust my hump every single\nday.\nIt took me a while, but I realized that I really\nappreciated those words...they're what made me\ninto the man I am today.\nThe Conqueror...that bastard Hermeien...\nI'll never forgive them for what they did. Never!
The Gaslin Caves are a stretch of caverns\ncreated by massive earthquakes long before\nAthlum was founded.\nRobelia Castle was built 300 years ago by Baron\nVonn d'Herouet, who, incidentally, was later\nbetrayed by one of his vassals and killed.\nBy now, both locations have come to be\ninhabited by monsters and criminals...
I look forward to working with you, Rush.
Rush, we should not waste any time. Let us rescue\nMiss Irina as soon as possible!
A mage wearing white and a flying Remnant have been\nconfirmed among the troops sighted invading Blackdale.\nIt's no question that they must be the same men we\nencountered at Dillmoor...\nWe must be careful not to underestimate them. Keep\nyour head about you, Rush.
As I'm sure you already know, the Academy is a\nworldwide organization which officially oversees all\nRemnant-related research.\nIf that Wagram character truly is connected to the\nAcademy, he has very influential backing. It will be no\nsimple matter to go after him.
As you probably know, Elysion is a city at the center\nof the continent.\nAlong the way, I'm sure we'll face unknown monsters\nand new groups of bandits...\nWell, we'll know once we see them!
Within the Temple of Elysion is a location known as\nthe Catacombs.\nOnce it was a burial place, but nowadays it is more\ninfamous as the birthplace of many\nstrange monsters.\nStrange, as in...how can I put this... It's\ndifficult\nto explain. Allow me to just say that I am not very\nfond of the Catacombs.
Emma may be going with you, but you should still be\nvery careful. Danger lurks around every corner.
The Duke of Nagapur, Wilfred Hermeien, is a youthful\nand extremely capable ruler. However, he is rumored to\nbe as cruel as he is clever...\nIf there is any hope for these negotiations to succeed,\nwe will have to be at least fractionally as shrewd as he is.
The Celapaleis forces are being heavily battered by the\nConqueror's army.\nAt this rate it's only a matter of time before they invade\nthe city. Rush, we must head to the Nest of Eagles\nwith all haste!
Miss Emmy is the spitting image of her mother when\nshe was young. It takes me back to when I first met\nLady Emma...\nWe will not allow her sacrifice to have been in vain!\nDuke Hermeien's machinations stop here!
Remember, you're before Lord David now.\nWatch your tongue.
Hmph, you're surprisingly competent.\nStill, the next battle stands to be difficult.\nMake certain you're amply prepared.
Going so far as to require Lord David to come along as\npart of their "request"... Celapaleis really loves rubbing\nour faces in it.\nStill, this could be a good chance to learn what that\nmagus in white is all about. We won't be letting him off\neasily this time.
Athlum is required to provide for Celapaleis's defense\nat all times.\nTheir assumption that we'll always protect them is\nsomething that is far from popular within Athlum.\nYet it is our duty as a territory.\nI know it, and understand it, but I certainly don't like\nit.
Elysion is considered the capital of the continent.\nA mass of rock floats above the city, called the\nSacred Lands. It's quite an impressive sight.\nStill, before all that, there's a long road ahead.\nDon't slack on your preparations.
There are many temples in Elysion's Genaade\nDistrict. The Temple of Elysion in particular has\na long and venerable history.\nConsidering how secretive the group we're dealing\nwith is, I doubt it will be a simple thing for us to\nenter the Temple...\nHmph, whatever. If our words aren't convincing\nenough, then our blades will have to be.
I have an idea of where Marina might have run\nto. We made each other a promise, once...\nI'll be waiting in Elysion's Hendler section. Find\nme there when you're ready.
Lord David seems to be getting stronger by the\nday.\nI had no idea he'd thought so deeply on\nAthlum's independence.\nHe's come quite a long way from the little boy\nwho clung to my skirts after his mother passed.
Hmph. To be certain, at first I only thought you\na silly, sheltered hayseed, but you've really\ngrown a lot. I admit I'm a bit impressed.\nThat said, don't get too full of yourself, Rush.
So...\nYou are the son of the famed Doctors Sykes.\nLord David is completely committed to helping\nyou locate your sister Irina.
There is still much we do not know about Remnants.\nThe idea of one that can fly ought not be so shocking...
The men spotted in Dillmoor were accompanied\nby an unidentified Remnant. Make haste in your\npreparations so that we may set out.
While to the uninitiated it may appear as if we\nwere equals, in actuality Athlum is a territory\nunder Celapaleis's domain.\nStill, to require Lord David to chase after a\nsimple group of unknowns is a situation I would\nprefer be avoided in the future.
It is rumored that there are segments of the\nAcademy dedicated to more...illicit types of\nRemnant testing.\nMayhap the mage in white is a part of that...\nStill, we do not yet have the evidence to\nconfirm either way. We must learn more about\nthese men before anything else.
Many Lords will assemble for the Congress\nsession\nall rulers of important and influential\ncountries. Please refrain from any rash actions.
As we have already been called out... Let's try\nto avoid any actions that would further draw\nChairman Hermeien's attention, shall we?\nPlease try to exercise discretion in searching\nthe Temple.
Information she is unwilling to reveal to Lord\nDavid? It isn't like Emma at all.\nWhat could be so important to require only the\ntwo of you to go\nto an unknown location, at\nthat?\nNo doubt the battles you will face along the way\nwill be harsher than any you've encountered thus\nfar. Prepare yourself accordingly.
Any concession we attempt to get from Duke\nHermeien will likely be paid for by Athlum\nbeing sent to fight the Conqueror.\nI wish Lord David success in his negotiations,\nyet...
While we were in Nagapur, the Conqueror's army\nadvanced all the way to Celapaleis...\nUnbelievable.\nTo think, they dominated so easily... The\nConqueror seems rightly named.\nIf we take this lightly, we'll be destroyed along\nwith Celapaleis.\nWe'll need to keep our wits about us.
Emma traded her life to protect this country.\nNow, we who are left must do all we can to\nhonor that.\nWilfred Hermeien is the one behind all this. We\nwill find him and we will destroy him. Emma's\nsacrifice will not have been in vain.
Hermeien used the Conqueror's army to throw the whole\nworld into confusion...that's unforgivable.\nI'll avenge my mother with these hands, I swear it!\nRush, let's get to Nagapur as soon as possible!
Fornstrand...?\nThere's supposed to be a Remnant there?
A report from the new chairman...Duke Ghor.\nHe's learnt there is a major Remnant located at\nFornstrand\n, on the dark sea to the north of the\ncontinent.\nLet's not waste any time, Rush.
Let's hurry to\nFornstrand\n, Rush.
Rush, there's been another urgent summons from\nthe Congress. We must head to\nElysion\nat once.\n...Please, don't worry about Irina.\nShe just wants to be by your side...even if that\njourney takes her to the battlefield. She cares for\nyou, Rush.
It will take some time for Dr. Sykes to finish his\nadjustments, so you're free to do what you like until\nthen. I'll send for you when there's any news.
Chairman Ghor has asked us all back to\nElysion\nfor\nan emergency meeting of the Congress.\nIf Miss Irina wishes to come along as well, I have no\ncomplaints. She's proven herself to be a skilled\nresearcher...much like her parents.
It seems that most of the Lords have been struck by\nsudden and fierce illnesses.\nI cannot believe this is just coincidence. We must look\ninto this further.
There is something terribly wrong with Duke Qubine.\nRush, let's head to\nGhor\n. The chairman should be\ninformed of this as soon as possible.\nThe warrior town of Ghor is just west of the\nHeroic Ramparts
It seems we will have to do something about the\nblack lights around\nKoenigsdorf\nif we wish to enter.\nTake care in your preparations, Rush. I've a feeling\nthese battles will be fiercer than we can even expect.
Irina seemed troubled by her powers, but I had no idea\nit would come to this...\nNo, there's no time for that. Let's hurry to\nDarken\nForest\n. I made a promise...I cannot allow Irina to be\nembroiled in our war any more than I already have.
The road to the imperial city is long and harsh.\nPast the highlands stretching east of Elysion,\nBerechevaltelle\n, and then over\nMt. Vackel\n...\nThere lies\nUndelwalt\nHowever, this is my first duty as representative\nof the Congress Chairman, and I intend to do it\nproperly.\nRush, once you've finished your preparations\nwe will set out.
To reach\nUndelwalt\n, we must travel east\nof Elysion to the great plains,\nBerechevaltelle\nand through there, climb\nMt. Vackel\nLet me know when you're ready, Rush; we'll\nleave once your preparations are complete.
...You know, the first time I laid eyes on you, I\nwas struck by how simple-minded and naïve\nyou seemed.\nI knew you bore some special power. I thought\nthat if I kept you close, I could control you, and\nhave you use that power to Athlum's advantage.\nBut hearing your words, I realized I've been\nblind. You've been the one in control all along\nshowing me the way.\nIn the end, it's I who's truly been simple-minded.\nThank you, Rush.\n...Well. I suppose this really isn't the time for\nsuch sentimental drivel.\nAll of Athlum's forces are to take up arms and\nstrike down the Conqueror! To the\nHoly Plain
The Conqueror is in the\nSacred Lands\nHe cannot be allowed to roam free any longer.\nHe must be stopped!
Rush, what is it?\nA sovani? Ah, Leucetius...\nNow that I think of it, he did seem to have had\nsome urgent complaint he wanted to voice...\nEither way, we just had a brief chat, then he left.\nIt's nothing you need to worry about.
Fornstrand, huh?\nI don't really like that place...\nThe sky's always covered with dark clouds...\nIt kinda gives me the willies.
Heya, Rush! Good news about your pop, huh. He was\nout of it for so long, I figured he was never gonna get\nbetter...\nWeeell, it all worked out, right? Sometimes it's good\nwhen I'm wrong!
Geez Louise, that Duke Ghor is a friggin' slave driver!\nDoesn't he ever remember that Athlum is far from just\nabout everywhere?\nStill, this time, the little missy's coming along, huh.\nShould be fun!
Geez-oh-Pete... Sure, the Lords are important and all,\nbut how come we've gotta find out what's wrong with\n'em? I thought that's what doctors were for...
I never seen Duke Qubine lookin' like that before...\nUsually he's kinda mouthy and annoying, but now\nI'm a little worried about him...
Those black lights, huh... Wonder what we're gonna find?\nEhh, doesn't matter\nwhatever it is, I'm gonna knock it\ninto next week! Aw geez! I'm shaking...with excitement!
What...what!? Going all alone to that creepy forest,\nwhat was that girl thinking!?\nC'mon, Rush, what're you standing around here for?\nWe gotta go find Irina and bring her back!
Rush, didja hear!? We just got independence from\nCelapaleis! Incredible, ain't it? I'm so psyched up,\nI can't sit still!\nGuess even that Qubine kid can be a nice guy\nsometimes!
This might sound kinda sappy, but I'm real glad I've had\nthe chance to fight alongside you and the young master.\nBut seriously, Rush, if you think we're gonna let you\nface the Conqueror all alone, you're dead wrong.\nWhether you're marching to the Sacred Lands or to the\ngates of the underworld itself, it doesn't matter. We're\nbrothers now\ntogether 'til the end!\nAwright! Time to take a deep breath and knock that\nConqueror from here to next Tuesday!
Heya, Rush.\nWhat's the deal with that sovani, Leucetius?\nHe busted in here all, "If you won't make me leader,\nI'll take the position myself!"\nIt wasn't much trouble to chase him off, though.
It's been some time since the Congress elected the\nDuke of Ghor as the new chairman, but still...\nI'm continually astonished at how he can work people\nso hard.
Hrm, the Conqueror still lives...\nWell, getting worked up won't help anyone think of a\ngood way to solve this problem.\nFor now, let's take it day by day... Do what we can\nand don't worry about the rest just yet, Rush.
Ever since her father recovered, Miss Irina has been\nquite engrossed in Remnant research. It seems the skill\nruns in the family.\nYou and Miss Irina have grown so quickly!\nAhh, to be young again...
If this trend of illnesses continues,\nI worry for Lord David's health...
As if the Conqueror wasn't enough of a headache, now\nthere's even more to deal with... For now, we should\nreport to Chairman Ghor and let him deal with this.
Those dark lights surrounding Koenigsdorf...\nWhatever is at each of those locations will do its worst\nto prevent us from getting to the Conqueror.\nFrom now on, our battles will be fierce. Let's make\ncertain we are amply prepared before we proceed.
It's said the mysterious Darken Forest has two very\ndifferent faces.\nOne a beautiful, sun-dappled grove, the other a dank,\nsmothering wildwood out of a nightmare...\nIt's rumored that within the forest is an unbound\nRemnant, spawning many monsters. We should go\nafter Miss Irina right away!
The imperial city of Undelwalt is an ancient and storied\ncity.\nOnce it was a bustling metropolis like Elysion, but ever\nsince the Congress was formed, the God Emperor's\ninfluence has waned, and with it, the might of the city.\nTo be honest, Undelwalt feels a bit run-down.
Rush... Since meeting you, we and Lord David have all\nchanged a great deal.\nFrom being preoccupied with the affairs of a single small\ncity, we've somehow come to be at the forefront of a\nbattle that affects the future of the entire world.\nIt's a bit of a change in scale, to say the least.\nIt's thanks to you that our horizons have been broadened\nso, and for that you have my deepest appreciation.\n...Anyhow! It's well past time for the final showdown,\nisn't it? Let's finish off the Conqueror, once and for all!
It's imperative that we find a new Remnant to\nrestore the faith of the Athlum people as soon\nas possible.\nWithout the Valeria Heart, the unease of the\npeople is palpable.
To think, the Conqueror's lackeys survived...\nI'm certain the Congress will move to take\naction, but we must stay on our guard.
While Chairman Ghor does tend to act as soon\nas the idea hits, this sudden Congress session\nseems based on an actual emergency.\nGranted, this is all supposition based on what\nlittle can be gleaned from a visistone\nrecording...
It is unheard of for the Lords to be absent at a session\nof the Congress. I cannot help but have a bad feeling\nabout this...
That uneasy feeling only increases, day by day... I can\nonly hope that I am overestimating the gravity of this\nsituation.
Extrapolating from Miss Irina's words, the\nlocations signified by those black points are, like\nHermeien, imbued with the power of a Remnant.\nThe thought that there are multiple bearers of\nsuch strength is distressing at best. For now,\nwe must extinguish the threats one by one.
Darken Forest is a wood that corresponds to\nreality. It can change its very form in response\nto the man brave\nor foolish\nenough to enter it.\nThat is an ancient sovani saying.\nUpon entering the forest, you will be able to\nfeel the movement of the trees. Surely we will\nbe able to feel Miss Irina's strong will as well.
Independence for Athlum was the deepest wish\nof the former Marquis.\nFor it to have come to pass in this way, while\nmuchly due to David's efforts, is also due to\nyour help.
Of late I have been surprised to see the rate of Lord\nDavid's development.\nAt first I thought he'd finally gained the former Marquis's\nspirit...but no. He's learnt more than that through these\nharrowing battles.\nI do not know exactly how, but it's due to you, Rush.\nWalking this path with you has allowed him to grow in\nways we could not teach him.\nTogether, let us face the Conqueror, and defeat him.\nAnd afterwards...please, continue to be at David's side.
An unknown Remnant at Fornstrand...\nWell, it's known of now... No doubt some shady types\nare going to go after it. Don't let down your guard, Rush.
Rush! Good to hear about your dad.\nBut...seems no good news comes without bad news\ncoming on its heels...\nI didn't even imagine the Conqueror was still alive...\nI will get revenge for Mother, I swear it!
Did you see your sister's expression when you suggested\nshe come along?\nI'd never seen her that happy. Seems she's wanted to be\nwith you\nor be accepted by you\nfor a while.\nDon't worry, we Generals aren't going to let anything\nhappen to her!
It's awfully strange for all the Lords to get sick at the\nsame time. I have a bad feeling about this.
Duke Qubine was talking about feeling someone else's\nthoughts...what was that all about?\nWe'd better keep our wits about us, alright, Rush?\nDon't get careless!
I can't believe Hermeien appeared in Ghor... And Irina\nsaid he had the same strange aura as those black\npoints on the Remnant locator.\nNo doubt he's completely bonkers...and all the more\ndangerous because of it.\nRush, don't underestimate him.
Irina's always been so responsible... There's got to be\na good reason for her to have gone someplace like\nDarken Forest all by herself.\nThat said, it's not like she had to go alone. No matter\nwhat the reason was, all of us would've been willing\nto help.\nNo use saying this to you, hmm? Instead, let's hurry\nand get Irina back.
Rush! It seems Athlum's already taken its first step\ntowards independence.\nI think...even Mother can hear everyone's happy cries.\nIf I listen closely, I think I can hear hers.
Ever since Mother died, and I became one of the\nGenerals of Athlum, I've dreamt of getting revenge\non the Conqueror.\nI thought that killing him would avenge her, and that\nwas enough for me.\nBut, after spending all this time with you, I can't help\nbut think that thought was awfully small-minded.\nSolely thinking of revenge probably isn't going to\nchange the world\nnot for the better, at least. It\nprobably will only spawn some other act of violence.\nAnd I'm tired of this endless fighting. This cycle needs\nto end. So, more than revenge, that's why I want to\nstop the Conqueror.\nYou've helped me open my eyes to the bigger picture,\nRush. I appreciate it.
Hello there, Rush.\nOh yes, some incredibly rude sovani came through here\nnot too long ago; wanted to be made leader of our party\nor some such nonsense.\nI tried to tell him that there was nothing I could do about\nit, but he just wouldn't listen. In the end, I had to beat\nsome sense into him.
Hey, you two, if things get hairy, just run away, got it?
Alternate routes to the Sacred Lands...\nWell, that place is so linked to Remnants, stands to\nreason there's at least one other way to get up there...
Once all this is over with, how about we all return to\nEulam, huh? Buck up, kiddo, we're on the home stretch.
Rush, Irina...\nPlease take care of yourselves.
A Remnant to travel to the Sacred Lands...\nFath\ner, I mean, Oswald might know something.
Rush...Irina...\nNo matter what happens, we'll always be a family.\nNever forget that.
Rush, I'll do what I can!\nBut don't worry\nI'll run if things get\ntoo dangerous.
A Remnant to go to the Sacred Lands?\nThe people of the Academy may know something.
Rush...\nWhen this is all over, we're all going home\nsafe and sound, right?\nPromise?

Howdy there! It's been a long spell since we've had\nanyone new come 'round these parts\n'specially a\nyoung buck like you.\nWelcome to Baaluk, the belle of the west\nor the end\nof the world, 'pending on who you ask. This is the\nGrentze Commune\n, our main settlement.\nWe don't get too many visitors, so I'm sure everyone'll\nbe real happy to see you!

So we've had another traveler come through town\nnot a cutie like you, though! He said he came from some\ncon-grass whozawhatzit group?\nHe went on about his organization bein' updated, with\nsome new feller in charge, like it was some of my\nbusiness...\nI didn't even know there were organizations like that, but\nso long as he wasn't asking for any money, it didn't\nbother me none.

Oh, it's you again, come back to visit. You'd better keep\non going through, hon. Somebody's done taken the\nBrimuslabus, can you believe it?\nThe Brimuslabus's stood here for hundreds of years,\nsealin' away an evil god.\nWithout the Remnant, that god'll be back...and all the\nmadder for it, I'll tell you what.\nOur poor village, this's gonna be the end...
Hoo-wee, can ya believe it? We were saved from that\nterrible disaster by Mr. Wyngale and his posse.\nPhew, I didn't know what to do, I don't even know\nhow to start to thank him. I was prayin' to every god I\ncould think of!
[[6th level message]](after the Remnant is stolen)
I reckon you saw them giant spikes stickin' out of the\ncliff down yonder. That's our Remnant, the Brimuslabus.\nTown legend says there was some terrible monster\nrunning wild, but the Imperator took the Remnant and\nsealed it in that very spot.\n'Course, that was hundreds of years ago... If'n there's\nany truth to it, I sure ain't the one to tell. Only\nhalf-believe it myself, actually.
The Brimuslabus is gone.\nI'm worried\nreal worried.\nSure hope the town legend is nothing more\nthan a fancy bedtime story.
[[3rd level message]]
Oh, get this. Some fancy-pants messenger strolled in\nfrom some far-off place. ...Reckon most everyplace is\npretty far-off from here, though.\nApparently those big city-types've been havin' themselves\na war or two, and lost all their Remnants, so, they sent a\nguy to come sniffing 'round here for unbound ones.\nYou can bet I gave him the evil eye 'til he gave up on\ntryin' to take the Brimuslabus, I tell you what.\nThe nerve of them city folk, comin' here to steal our\nRemnant! They'd just let that varmint sealed by the\nImperator come back, huh?

I'll be a monkey's uncle. That story 'bout the demon and\nthe Imperator was the honest truth after all.\nDamnation, 'til now we been able to drive off everyone\ntryin' to get their hands on the Brimuslabus. How in\nblazes did this happen?\nWelp, ain't nothin' to be done about it now. I was raised\nhere by my pappy and him by his pappy before that. I'm\nstayin' here 'til the end.
Hey, have ya heard?\nSome terrible big beast showed up here, an' that sovani,\nWyngale, beat the tar out of it!\nAll this time I figgered he was just some crazy kook,\nwho'd have thunk he'd end up all o' our saviors?
[[6th level message]](after the Remnant is stolen)
A couple times a year, a caravan of traders rolls through.\nThey come selling all kinds of equipment and other\nexotic stuff from the east.\nSome o' them traders were saying there's s'posed to be\nsome huge cities, a couple times bigger than here, even.\nSpeaking plainly, I think they were just pulling my leg.\nLike someplace that big could really exist, come on,\nI'm no idiot!
[[2nd level message]]
Hoo-wee, was I surprised!\nSome feller from the east\ncalled himself an emissary\nor somesuch\ncame all the way out here to Grentze\nfrom the capital city, Elysion.\nSeems the folks on the continent all got into some\nfightin', and lost a bunch of their Remnants. Shame,\nain't it?\nAnyhow, I guess the world's pretty big after all.\nKinda makes me wanna strike out and do some\nexplorin' myself!

Whoa there, pardner! This ain't no place to be\nlollygagging!\nDidn't you know? The legendary beast what was\nsealed around here's woken up!\nThere ain't nothin' left for this town, sure as\nI'm standin' here\nso I'm hoofing it out. Dunno\nwhere I'm headin', but it can't be worse.
Hey, pardner\nizzit true what they say, that the\nvarmint what was s'posed to destroy the village was\nbeaten?\nI heard tell that square peg of a sovani what lived\nhere came in with his pals an' saved the village.\nPretty amazin', ain't it?\nI was on the road outta town when I heard the\nrumor, so I came back t' check it out.
See that sovani knight standin' over by the cliffs?\nThat's Mr. Wyngale.\nMama says he's protected Grentze for a long, long\ntime\neven since before I was born!
[[2nd level message]]
Mr. Wyngale stands there every day and prays towards\nthe Brimuslabus.\nWonder if his arms get tired, standin' like that all the\ntime...\nI'd go and switch off with him so he could rest, but I\nhaven't got but two arms...
[[4th level message]]
Mister, what're we gonna do?\nThe Brimuslabus is gone, and Mama says some real\nscary monster's come out!\nMr. Wyngale'll be able to do somethin' about it...right?
Hey, mister, didja see? That scary monster ain't here no\nmore. Mr. Wyngale found it and whupped it but good!\nHe's just amazing!\nWhen I grow up, I wanna be just like him!
I am Wyngale.\nI've stood here for hundreds of years, watching over\nthe Remnant Brimuslabus and what it seals.
Foolish qsiti.\nThe Brimuslabus has not blessed this town.\nOr perhaps, it has.\nPerhaps it has prevented Him from awakening.\nThat would indeed be a blessing.\nHmph...
Huh?\nWhat're you doing here, old lady?
Wha\nexcuse me?\nDo I even know you?
Oh, oops.\nUm, I thought you were someone else...
Hmph! Make sure you have the right\nperson next time!
S-sorry...
Hmph... I'll let it slide this time. Of course, that's on\nthe condition that there's never a second.
Calling someone "old lady" is rude and inconsiderate...\nespecially when they aren't old!
Hm? You again.
Uh.
You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!\nSay, ol\nO beautiful young maid, what're you doing\naround here?
Training.\nIn my family, it's a rite of passage to travel the world.
Huh... Sounds pretty tough.\nTake care of yourself, okay?
...Ahh. Thank you.
You're not as inconsiderate as I thought.
You're looking well.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
...Right. So, could you please not call me that?\nIt's rather bothersome, to be honest.
Well, it's not like I know your name.
Oh?
...
The name's Emmy.
Nice to meet you for real, finally. I'm
Rush. Rush Sykes.\nRight?
Wha\n? How did you know!?
I have my ways.
Take care, Rush.
What's the purpose of my training?\nWell...a lot of things. But in general,\ntraining the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.

I thought I'd done plenty of training, but I still can't\neven light a candle to Mother... But there's no way\nI'm giving up now.
Ohh, Rush.\nFinally, I'm free.\nFinally, the time has come when I can kill that man!
Who do I mean?\nWho indeed? Could be anyone.\nCould be someone you know very well...\nHeheheheh...
Heheheheh...
I was chained to the Brimuslabus hundreds of years\nago... Back when the Imperator still ruled the world.\nYou don't believe me?\nHeheheh...\nThe bastard was...unpleasant, to say the least.\nI infuriated him because of my awesome strength\nand the fact that he couldn't break my spirit.\nSo when he ran out of use for me, he forced me\nto bind the Brimuslabus and act as the Fallen's seal.\nWhat a pitiful man he was.\nHeh heh heh...
Heh heh heh...
Rush...\nIt's...it's beginning to come back to me...\nThe person I was then...\nWorking with the Imperator, fighting for the Imperator.\nFighting all the time...\nAnger...destruction...chaos...death...\nIt was so much fun.\nThe best days I've ever spent...\nAnd then...that man...\nThe Imperator himself tried to snatch it all away!\nBut now...now we see who's truly won...\nMuh...muh...mwa-hahahahaha!!!
Mwa-hahahahaha!!!
Before he left me here, he told me something...\n"We'll meet again if the fates allow."\nHeh heh heh...\nI can feel it...feel it strongly.\nThe feel of his soul, not fully claimed by death...\nWait for me, spirit wandering the space between\nheaven and earth. Wait, because I'm going to find\nyou and destroy you.\nThere won't even be a sliver of soul left when I'm\ndone with you!\nFinally, you'll regret what you've done!\nBwah-hahahahahahah!!!
Rush! I feel amazing!\nWhen you go to battle, make sure you tell me. Got it?\nDon't you dare go without me!
Rush...\nThis time at last, all my bonds have been released...\nBut... I just don't understand this feeling of emptiness...
Heya, Rush.\nSorry I kinda tricked ya into helping Baaluk.\nBut I really appreciate the help, honest!
Hey! You're not still mad at me, are you? I know I went\nabout things the wrong way so we kinda got off on the\nwrong foot...\nB-but, anyway, from now on I'm totally committed to\ndoing anything to help out Baaluk! So go on, gimme an\norder! I'm all ears!\nI'm all ready to go, so just say the word!
I'm gonna help out as hard as I can!\nAny time you wanna head out, just say the word!
Huh? Ah\nR-Rush...\nH-hey, how's it going, did you need something?\nHm? Something wrong\nwith me?\nN-no, of course not! Not a bit! Ahahahah...\nA-anyway, it's not time to go already, is it? If we've\nstill got some time, maybe you could give me a moment\nalone...
H-hey, Rush. Is it time to go already?\nIf not, maybe you could leave me alone for a minute...
Rush...\nI think...I've been tricked.\nMaybe all of us have. And I think it's all my fault...\nYanno, the one who told me that the Brimuslabus was\nabout to Collapse was that guy Wyngale.\nHe's always been calm and serious, always acting with\nthe town's best interests at heart. But ever since they\ntook the Brimuslabus, it's like he totally changed...\nOr maybe he's just showing his true colors. Maybe he\nnever cared about Baaluk at all in the first place...\nAnd what's more, you know those guys we gave the\nRemnant to? I have this really, really bad feeling about\nthem...\nOh man, what if all this time I've been acting high and\nmighty, thinking I was the town's hero, when really I've\njust been playing right into the bad guys's hands?\nAugh, we don't even have a Remnant anymore! What's\ngoing to happen to Baaluk now? ...I don't know what I'll\ndo if something awful happens...
What's going to happen to Baaluk now?\nI don't know what I'll do if something awful happens...
There are towns that don't have Remnants?\nAnd you're from one of them!?\nWow!\nThen maybe Baaluk will be okay too!\nJust maybe...\nThanks, Rush!\nThanks for telling me and giving me hope!\nI said some awful things about Wyngale...\nI don't know why I doubted him. I need to have\nmore faith in people and what they can do...\nBut now's not the time to dwell on the past.\nIt's time to turn Baaluk into a town everyone\nwants to live in!
Okay, Rush, you've got me fired up!\nI'm gonna work to make Baaluk a town everyone wants\nto live in\neven if it doesn't have a Remnant!
There's some power coming from the remains\nof the Brimuslabus...something strong... I can't\nbelieve this happened. I only wanted to help Baaluk...\n...\nYeah... Maybe...this really is my fault.\nAnd if so, I've gotta do something to help!\nRush\nI've gotta bring back the Brimuslabus.\nI mean, if everything's back to how it was before,\nthat's gotta make everything okay, right?\nI know that you don't really have time to look into\nwhat the Academy is doing, but what you are doing\ndoesn't seem that far off to me...\nSo...please, continue to let me fight with you.\nEven if it's roundabout...I've gotta do something!
Rush!\nHave you heard anything from the Academy?
What? Do you need something?
Something wrong?
Have you seen Lord David?\nI do not feel comfortable letting him alone.\nIf you see him, please tell him I am looking for him.
Troublemaker...
...
On the surface, it does not seem like this place has\nchanged very much...\nThat said, it is no place to let Lord David run about\nunsupervised. If you see him, tell him I am looking\nfor him.
You haven't seen Lord David?
If it was only going to be stolen anyway,\nwe should have taken the Remnant ourselves...\n...No, Lord David would never have stood for it.
Please forget I said anything.
And we must assume the Conqueror is even\nmore powerful than that monster...
...
The Remnant Ark...\nSurely there must be a similar Remnant elsewhere\nin the world...
I can think of nothing...
Lord David is as prepared as he can be.\nAll I have to do is to follow.
Ahh...what a spectacular Remnant.\nIt just has a certain mystique, doesn't it?\nI feel as if I'd never tire of looking at it...\nHowever...it does look a bit like a pincushion,\ndoesn't it...
Incredible...
...
After learning of Remnants disappearing the world\nover, I'd become a bit wary, but look. This place is the\nsame as always...it's a small but appreciated blessing.
Yes, yes.
Then, it's just like Athlum...\nThe whole mood of the town is different.
What in the world is going on?
I lived through it yet can hardly believe it...\nTo think that such a fiend existed in this world...!
...
It must exist, somewhere...
Let's continue to search.
Let's finish this...learn the true ending of this tale.
Come and check out the weapons they have!\nAhh, from blunt to sharp, fancy decorative stuff\nto everyday weapons, I love 'em all!
Heheheheh...
Lady Emma...
Heya, Rush! Check it out\nthe Remnant's still alive\nand kicking! So we can't get all down either, right?
We can't lose hope now!
Even the weapons seem kinda pooped out...\nGuess it's 'coz the Remnant's gone...
Geez, even the weapons seem pooped out...
The heck was that all about?\nGeez, at least we won.\nDon't gotta worry about that thing anymore!
Don't gotta worry about that thing anymore!
If I have to think about this Remnant stuff any more,\nmy head's gonna explode! You just tell me where\nto go when you've figured it out, okay?
I'm ready to rock whenever!
Let's go, Rush!\nDon't worry\nI'll knock down anybody in our way!
What am I doing?\nJust as it looks, taking a walk. As the Marquis, I can't\njust roam the streets alone in Athlum or Celapaleis...\nI'm certain Torgal is having conniptions, but let's keep\nthis between us, shall we?
Remember\nthis is our secret.
This town's Remnant still stands.
...
Here as well...\nIt is not only Athlum that's lost its Remnant...
...
To think, something like that was sealed by the\nBrimuslabus...\nWe're lucky nothing like that was sealed beneath\nthe Valeria Heart...
...
What am I rushing around for?\nTo be honest, I was mainly trying not to be recognized...
I hope we're not too late...
Let's go, Rush!\nAnd we'll return together\nvictorious!
The town may look the same as always,\nbut that's only at first glance.\nThere's plenty of rumbling beneath the surface...\nThis is no time to start slacking.
This place is rotten...
They've lost their Remnant as well...\nI suppose it could be just coincidence...\nCertainly seems like a plot, though...
I can't believe someone isn't behind all this...
Good god... A Remnant powerful enough to seal a\nbeast like that\nwhat kind of being was able to handle\nthat sort of power?
...
Hey now, quit playing around and help us search, will\nyou? There's got to be another way to get to the\nSacred Lands, but we won't find it if you don't look.
Don't worry\nwe'll find it.
I'll look after Lord David since she cannot...\nSo you'd better do the same for Irina.

Chee!\nI think I've seen something I shouldn't have...!\nYou seem the curious type, but curiosity killed\nthe qsiti\nalmost, anyhow! Who'd have thought\nsuch a thing lurked in the Yvalock's Nest?\nTo begin with, all the Yvalocks were supposed\nto have been wiped out ages ago! But what I\nmet in that cave was far from dead...\nWaaah, I won't be sleeping a wink tonight!
He-llo... So, you crossed the Vale of the Gods all by\nyour lonesome?

Well, well! It's been a spell since we've had a new face.\nWelcome to the Rift!
All the mess that guy talks, and when it's actually\ndangerous, that's when he actually follows through?\nFoolish old man...\nAnd what's up with leaving that ridiculous letter?\n"Not trying to cause trouble"\nmore like "there's\nnothing you can do to stop me"!
I saw you and Wyngale fight that giant monster.\nThanks.
I saw you and Wyngale fight that giant monster.\nThanks. I'm sure the old man's laughing his head off\nup past the pearly gates.
Hey! Howdy, traveler! Don't see many like you\n'round these parts. Sit and drink a spell!
Well I'll be! It's been a spell since I've had a\ncustomer. What can I do you for, sir?
What's this? You, you are an unfamiliar face.\nDoing a bit of traveling, sport?\nTake a seat, have some tea. At least it doesn't have\nany problems with it... I'm the owner here, and you\nwouldn't believe the troubles I've had.\nI actually started out in Balterossa. Never have to\nworry about having too few customers there, eh?\nIt's pricey though. I couldn't turn a profit.\nSo...that's how I ended up out here on\nthe edge of the world.
Sad thing is\nand this is where it really adds insult to\ninjury\neven this tiny pub out in the boonies couldn't\nbe run all alone.\nSo...I was desperate. I went to town, found two guys\nwho looked like they didn't have anything else to do,\nand hired 'em. Talk about an epic failure!\nWhere do I start? The younger guy's a lazy dog. I've\nseen corpses that're more productive, ugh. But you\nknow how mitra can be...no offense.\nThen the old guy, bless him, he's enthusiastic enough,\nbut completely incompetent. Can't remember customer\norders for the life of him.\nThe customers themselves are mostly down-and-out\nmercenaries, so not really the type you wanna get too\nfriendly with, you know?\n*sigh*\nI always dreamed of having a bustling pub full of\nattractive patrons having stimulating conversations\nabout adventure and intrigue...
Ach, sorry, sorry. You come in here for a drink and\nthen I end up talking your ear off.\nAnyway, next time you come out here, come back and\nvisit, alright? There'll be a hot pot of tea waiting for\nyou, my treat.
In addition to an impressive selection of wines and\nspirits, here at The Rift we offer tea with every order.\nThe tea leaves are imported from Melphina\nand\ndon't think it doesn't cost a fortune.\nStill, thanks to that, we keep a steady stream of\ncustomers all day long. ...Er, until recently, anyhow.
Hey, sport! How's it going? You would not believe what's\nbeen going on with me lately, it's just terrible, terrible.\nSee\n...You don't wanna listen? You have to go?\nOh. I...I see.
Ohh! Heya, sport!\nYanno, when I heard some legendary monster'd been\nreborn or whatever, I was all ready to close up shop.\nDamn shame too, after coming all this way and all...\nSo you can imagine my relief to find that you guys\ntook care of all the trouble! Talk about good news!\nI guess I like this town more than I thought.
Hey, someone else from the "outside." I'm not from\nhere either... Last year I was hired to escort a guy out\nhere.\nThing is, once we made it to town, the guy disappeared\nwithout paying me!\nI've been trapped here since then... I'm just working\nto make enough cash to get out of this hole.\nNothing happens here at all...this place is like a complete\nwaste of space. I can't wait to get the hell out!
Oh, hey, outsider.\nDon't worry about the dishes, alright?\nI finally saved up enough to leave Grentze, but I think\nI'm gonna hang around a little bit longer.\nI mean, look at these people. Leaving them alone is like\nsending a bunch of toddlers to face the Ghor army.\nI'm not that cruel!
Oh man... So apparently, this legendary god-demon\nthing\nno one here can decide which\nhas been\nawakened. People are going bananas.\nGeez, I guess it's up to me to take care of everyone...\nI mean, I am a mercenary, after all. Fighting's what I do.\nAnd I'll fight to protect this town!
Wyngale stole my gig!\nDidn't I say I was gonna be protecting Grentze?\n...Heh, psych. I tried heading over there and my knees\nstarted shaking like they were gonna give out...\nThought I was gonna die just looking at the thing.\nSeriously, Wyngale is this town's hero.
You again?\nI'm on break, alright? Leave me alone.
You again.\nLook. I can understand why you'd want to talk to\nme\nI know how impressionable young boys are,\nbut break time is me-time, alright?\n...\n...The hell is that stupid expression for?\nOh, don't tell me...\nYou don't have the slightest idea who I am, do you?\nWell, damn.\nI didn't know people like you even existed.
You have no idea who I am, do you?\nI didn't know they made kids like you anymore.
Hey.\nSeriously, you've never heard of me?\nNot to toot my own horn, but in the world of mercenaries,\nI'm known as the King.\nSure, I figured downgrading from war contracts to little\njobs like this might get me ragged on or something,\nbut an employer who doesn't know me from Adam?\n...Whatever. Just looking at you I can tell you're just a\nlittle puppy, still suckling at his mama's teat, eh?\nHow 'bout it then, why don't you test your hand?\nGotta warn you, though\njust a bout or two of\nsparring ain't gonna bless you with my luck in battle.\nHahahahaha!\n...\n...You could at least pretend to look interested.
Not to toot my own horn, but when it comes to\nmercenaries, I'm known as the King.\nC'mon, how 'bout you show me your moves?
Pup, you're back!\nYou ready to show me what you've got?\n...What, now you look like someone stole your last\nbone. Don't like being called a little puppy, do you?\nDon't get me wrong, kid, I'm not trying to put you\ndown to look big or anything.\nIn fact, you got a good look in your eye... I can tell\nyou're a fighter. Let's focus that...make you\nactually worth something.\nWhaddaya think of that, me as your teacher?\nIf you ask me, I think you should feel honored.\nWhat, you doubt my skill? You think I'm full of it?\nFeh. Think what you want. So what're you gonna\ndo about it?\nIf you know someone who thinks they could beat me,\nbring 'em on. I'll show 'em how strong\nor weak\nthey\nreally are. Hahahahaha!
Heya, pup!\nYou know someone who thinks they can beat me?\nBring 'em on! I'll show them the error of their ways.
You again? You seriously don't understand the point\nof time off, do you? Just let me rest, ugh. I feel like\nthe Sacred Lands fell on me.\nThis's all your doing, isn't it? Some yama in a mask\ncomes up to challenge me to a fight\ncome on, like\nI wouldn't know it's Duke Ghor.\nHe was carrying the Bilqis, for crying out loud. What\nthe hell kind of idiots is he used to dealing with?\nDamn... Thanks to that, I can't feel my face...\nSorry, Rush. I took a little bruise to my pride and let\nit blow up into all this mess.\nGuess I shouldn't slack on my training either. Whaddya\nthink, Rush, you up for some lessons?

Baaluk is currently without a lord.\nThe two sons of the previous lord do nothing but\nargue over who is more fit for the position...\nThe closest we've got to a ruler is Wyngale. He's\nprotected this town for a long time. But without\na lord, who knows when there might be a Collapse?
This Brimuslabus is gone...\nI pray that things will change for the better.
It's hard to believe it's come to this... But I was born and\nraised in this town. Reckon I'll stay with it to the end.\nIt's like all the stories said... The Brimuslabus was the\nguardian angel to us all...
There is no way we can ever fully thank Wyngale for what\nhe's done.\nThe Brimuslabus may be gone, but there's still a future\nfor this town...it's one we're all willing to work together\nto make.
The next leader of Baaluk is gonna be me! My\nlittle brother's such an idiot he tried milking\nbulls! Like I'm gonna leave Baaluk to him!
The next leader of Baaluk is gonna be me!\nBut so long as the Brimuslabus's gone, I gotta\nfigure something out to take care of this fix we're in...
I figure I was acting like a kid before. Wyngale saved\nthe town and gave us a second chance...\nI'm gonna cooperate with my little bro from now on.
I-I'm going to be the next ruler of Baaluk... I\nhope! My older brother is too hot-headed... I-I\ndon't want to leave the Brimuslabus to him!
I can hardly believe this is happening...
I can't tell you how many nights I spent with my\nbrother, trying to figure out how to save the town...\nAnd that's when I realized just how much he\ncares about Baaluk, and what he'd sacrifice for it...\nFrom now on, we're gonna think of how we can\nhelp out the village\ntogether.

This is Celapaleis's main street, Grants Way.\nYou see the palace down the way, do you not?\nThat is where our ruler, Duke Qubine, resides.\nAll along this street are shops offering every\nearthly delight, so you should take a look.
[[2nd level message]]
[[3rd level message]]
Oh my! It seems that Athlum has had its Valeria Heart\nstolen by that wretched Conqueror! It's the buzz of the\ntown, to be honest.\nJust the thought of the Umbermarici disappearing is\ndepressing. I wonder, are the people of Athlum okay?
My goodness... There's so much to worry about\nnowadays it's hard to even sleep!\nWhy? ...You don't know!? Poor Duke Qubine\nhas fallen ill!\nAccording to the travelers on the Way, he's\ngrown weaker every day...\nDamnation, is there nothing we can do?
[[6th level message]]
Weapons, items, accessories, components...\nYou can find anything down this street.\nMy favorite is...\nOh, certainly, the high-grade medicinal herbs imported\nfrom the south. Once you get a whiff, you'll be sold\nfor life.
[[2nd level message]]
[[3rd level message]]
I never imagined the Conqueror's forces were\nthat strong...!\nI was on guard duty here while my wounded\ncomrades were brought back from battle...\nIt was like some story about the end of days...\nLord Qubine has ordered a strengthening of all\nforces, so all the shopkeepers have upgraded\ntheir inventory.\nIf the Conqueror and his thugs try coming around\nhere again, we'll be ready to knock the living\ndaylights out of them.
The rumor going around is that that bright light\nfrom a while back was Nagapur's Remnant going\ncrazy and destroying the city.\nI've also heard that Lord Qubine's been feeling\npoorly lately.\nIs Celapaleis going to be destroyed just like\nNagapur was? We'll be alright, right?
[[6th level message]]
Isn't the view amazing? There isn't any other\nplace in the world that's covered with a\nRemnant like this!\nEvery one of those crystals floating in the air\nis the Remnant Umbermarici.\nSo long as Lord Qubine has bound the Remnant,\nthose crystals will glow, and the people of the\ntown will be happy and healthy.\nThe might and glory of Celapaleis is linked to\nthe Umbermarici, for certain.
[[2nd level message]]
Not even the forces of Ghor could easily take\nCelapaleis\nyet the Conqueror's forces cut\nthrough our men like tissue paper...\nThe Conqueror's forces must be demons\nstraight from hell! How else could they have\nsuch strength?\nThat bright light must have appeared to stop all\nthat fierce fighting... It's only thanks to the\nUmbermarici that we're still here at all!
Ever since Lord Qubine's health began to fail, I've been\nloath to look at the sky.\nAt times... It seems like the Umbermarici will glimmer\nwith an odd, off-color glow...\nNo\nforget I said anything! That's impossible, it must\nbe my imagination...
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...\nYou there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?\nYeah...why?\nYou're mistaken, old man.

Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...\nYou're Rush Sykes, right?\nYup, I'm Rush!\nNever heard of the guy.
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.\nHe says he's come up with a good starting place for\ninformation-gathering, and that you should come to\nthe\ncastle\nfor details.\nGot it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,\nthough\nyou're not in trouble...not with us at least.\nLord David's put out a summons for you.\nApparently he's come up with a good starting place for\nyour information-gathering, so he'd like you to come\nto the\ncastle\nso he can share it with you.\nDon't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you\nmight end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...\nYou must be Rush Sykes, are you not?\nThe one and only!\nNot if he's in trouble...

Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!\nI bring a message from Lord David. He requests that\nyou come to the\ncastle\nat your nearest convenience.

Wha\nexcuse me?\nDo I even know you?
Oh, oops.\nUm, I thought you were someone else...
Hmph! Make sure you have the right\nperson next time!
S-sorry...
Hmph... I'll let it slide this time. Of course, that's on\nthe condition that there's never a second.
Calling someone "old lady" is rude and inconsiderate...\nespecially when they aren't old!
Hm? You again.
Uh.
You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!\nSay, ol\nO beautiful young maid, what're you doing\naround here?
Training.\nIn my family, it's a rite of passage\nto travel the world.
Huh... Sounds pretty tough.\nTake care of yourself, okay?
...Ahh. Thank you.
You're not as inconsiderate as I thought.
You're looking well.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
Could you please not call me that?\nIt sounds ridiculous, to say the least.
Well, it's not like I know your name.
Oh?
...
The name's Emmy.
Nice to meet you for real, finally.\nI'm
Rush. Rush Sykes.\nRight?
Wha\n? How did you know!?
I have my ways.
Take care, Rush.
What's the purpose of my training?\nWell...a lot of things. But in general,\ntraining the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.

You're still searching for your sister, aren't you?\nI wish there was something I could do to help...
You're still searching for your sister, aren't you?\nI wish there was something I could do to help...
Of course I keep in touch with my family.\nThat's how I know about you.
Of course I keep in touch with my family.\nThat's how I know about you.
I thought I'd done plenty of training, but I still can't\neven light a candle to Mother... But there's no way\nI'm giving up now.
I thought I'd done plenty of training, but I still can't\neven light a candle to Mother... But there's no way\nI'm giving up now.
Ah? Rush...\nAre you doing well?\nI suppose I ought to thank you for last time...\nFor the business in Celapaleis, I mean.
I truly enjoy this place. The feel of the buildings,\nthe hustle and bustle of the people...\nThe country of Gilles-Barre felt like this, once.
This area is so reminiscent of the country of\nGilles-Barre... The people, the feel of the streets...
Around the time of my father's death, the house\nof Gilles-Barre had taken a terrible fall. I took it\nupon myself to restore the honor of our house.\n...That's why I hated my husband. I resented\neverything he was...\nI knew he cared for me. But how could he know\nhow it felt to fall from grace? He wasn't one of us.\nHe could never understand my rage...or so I thought.\nThinking on it now, it's I who didn't understand...
I took it upon myself to restore my family to its\nformer glory... Looking back now, I realize I really\ndid not understand anything.
Lately, I've been having a strange dream.\nIt's of the day the former Duke Qubine died.\nIn it, I am returning from the palace, weeping as I go...\nThe sun is setting, bathing the whole town in\na golden red light. Mother holds my hand, and\nFather looks at me with a bitter smile...\nIt's been so long. It felt so real. So warm...\nBut, that's how I felt until recently, I suppose.\nMy father, my mother, my memories... All were\nstolen from me by Duke Qubine. So when he\ndied, it was only what he deserved, or so I felt...\nLooking at it with a clear mind, I can see that\nthe view then was just as it is now\nbeautiful.
In the past and today, this road is beautiful.\nI can see that, now...
Rush...\nFor a long time I felt that if only Duke Qubine was\ngone, the Gilles-Barres family would recover its\nland, its riches, and most importantly, its honor.\nBut I've finally realized that those things are not\ntruly what I've been hoping to get back all this time.\nWhat I really wanted was my mother and father, and the\nhappy times we spent together. That's what I've been\nchasing all this time.\nOdd, isn't it? Even if my house were returned to its\nformer standing right now, it would not undo the past....\nThe thing I've most wanted is not something I can\ntake by force. But at the same time, it's something\nthat already exists in my heart.\nIt's up to me to keep the memories I have left...\nIt's up to me to live up to them.\nI've been a fool...\n...\nRush...thank you for allowing me to say all this.\nIn explaining myself, I feel like I've finally begun to\nheal...
Ah, hello, Rush.\nI'm off to offer flowers at my parents' graves.\nWhat sort of flowers do you think they would like?
Oh, it's you! Thanks for helping me out earlier.\nIf you need any customizations, definitely let\nme know!

This is the Lamberro District of Celapaleis. Farther down\nthe street you can see the Guild. It's a place where\nmany skilled adventurers gather.\nOver here is the Amber Tavern, the local pub.\nIt's very popular with some types...\nOh, I don't mean how you think\napparently the\nbeautiful barkeep is the Amber's big draw.

To think that anyone would attack Celapaleis!\nMany of the strong warriors at the guild headed\nto the Nest of Eagles only to come back\nterribly wounded\nor not at all...\nUgh, it makes me shiver even to remember it...\nWhat are we to do if we're attacked again?
The Conqueror's army was defeated\ncompletely\ndefeated, wasn't it?\nI heard at the Amber that soldiers from the\nConqueror's army were spotted in the woods to\nthe north.\nI don't want to believe such a rumor, but...\nAdding to that, Lord Qubine is ill... Terrible\nthings are all around, it seems...

A long long time ago here in Celapaleis, there\nwas a really pretty stone.\nIt was so pretty that people were totally\nmesmerized by it...enough to do evil things.\nPretty soon the town was in trouble.\nBut one day a traveler came through town, and\nsaw the stone, and bound it.\nFrom then on, it didn't do anything else bad,\nand everyone was happy.\nWhaaat, you still don't know what I'm talking\nabout? It's the story of the Umbermarici! Man,\nyou're stupid! Everybody here knows that!

*sniffle sniffle*\nTh-that was so scary!\nTh-they brought back the soldiers, an' they were\nall hurt\nhurt bad... *sniffle*\nBut...the bad guys ran away! The Umbermarici\nscared 'em off, I bet!\nThe Umbermarici always protects us!
Hey mister, what'll we do? I heard some rumors\nabout the nobles...like, that the Duke is real\nsick!\nWhat if he has to break his bind with the\nUmbermarici\nand it makes everybody turn bad\nlike in the old days?\nI don't want that to happen!\nStupid Umbermarici!

His Highness, Lord Qubine may look young, but\nhe is quite adept at mystic arts.\nI have heard there are rabble-rousers within\nthe Ghor castle guard who are so afraid of his\nstrength that they spread rumors about it...\nOutlandish claims like Lord Qubine is an alien\nor some Academy-produced magickal boy or\nsomething... Ridiculous.\nOf course, what else could be expected to come\nfrom a town like that?\nThose uncouth boors are lucky to be able to string\ntwo sentences together... It's certainly not worth\nworrying about what they think.

General Honeywell of Athlum has fallen in\nbattle... She was well known as a true and\nvaliant warrior. It is a regrettable loss.\nHere in Celapaleis the ruler does not have\nanyone to support him.\nOur strength is based on Lord Qubine's\nmystical power and direction.\nIf something were to happen to him, who knows\nwhat would happen to us all...
Lord Qubine's condition is getting worse by\nthe day.\nUntil now, the prime minister and army leaders\nhave strutted like the cocks of the walk... Now\nthey run around like their heads were cut off.\nThey're completely worthless\nwithout a ruler\nthey can do nothing.\nBut, we, the people of Celapaleis, can do little\nmore...\nAll that's left is to hope and pray for Lord\nQubine's recovery...
You here from Athlum? Ahh...how ya like seeing\na real city? Celapaleis ain't anything like your\nbackwater hole.\nAt least you make a good guard dog, haw haw!\n'S thanks to Athlum that those Ghor scumbags\ndon't try anything.\nOr at least, if they did, they'd have to go\nthrough you first, haw haw!\nHeh, well, keep up the good work, Athlum\nschmucks!

The hell is going on? Some jerkwads calling\nthemselves the Conquerors trekked all the way\nfrom BFE to attack us!\nAnd where the hell were you, Athlum?

Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...\nYou there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?\nYeah...why?\nYou're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...\nLord David put out a summons...he said he needed to\nspeak with you about something. Hurry to the\ncastle
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere\nif you're\nplaying at all.\nLord David put out a summons...he said he needed to\nspeak with you about something. Hurry to the\ncastle
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...\nYou're Rush Sykes, right?\nYup, I'm Rush!\nNope, I'm, uh, someone else.
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.\nHe says he's come up with a good starting place for\ninformation-gathering, and that you should come to\nthe\ncastle\nfor details.\nGot it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,\nthough\nyou're not in trouble...not with us at least.\nLord David's put out a summons for you.\nApparently he's come up with a good starting place for\nyour information-gathering, so he'd like you to come\nto the\ncastle\nso he can share it with you.\nDon't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you\nmight end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...\nYou must be Rush Sykes, are you not?\nThe one and only!\nDepends on who's asking.
Well met!\nDavid, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come\nto\nAthlum Castle\nat your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!\nI bring a message from Lord David. He requests that\nyou come to the\ncastle\nat your nearest convenience.
Oh, hello.\nI have a bit of a headache...\nI'm sorry, but could you let me be for a while?
Rush, I completely understand how you feel about\nIrina.\nI had a sister as well\nmy twin, Kate.\nShe was completely opposite to me in personality...\nShe died some years ago, though...
I had a sister too\nmy twin, Kate.\nBut she died years ago...\nShe always acted like my complete opposite.
Oh, it's you...\nLately, I've been thinking about my sister a lot.\nKate died in a terrible accident.\nI wasn't able to save her...\nI... I just...\nAh\nahh, I'm sorry.\nI didn't mean to bring up such a heavy topic...\nHey, you don't need to look so sorry for me.\nThis all happened a long time ago...\n...\nUgh, men, always harping on about the past...\nYou. Who are you, Rush or whatever? Tell this\nbonehead to hurry up and get over me, alright?\n...\n...What...did I just black out? Urg...\nI'm sorry, I don't seem to be feeling well. Could\nyou leave me alone for a while?\nCPC_0102_MP0:NPC:45Even though she died years ago, I just can't get Kate\nout of my head... I'm sure if she were here she'd fuss\nat me for being foolish...
Ohh, you again. Up for hearing more bitching, eh?\nI mean, I can't think of any other reason you'd\nwanna chat. ...Guess it sucks for you, too, eh?\nI mean, look at this guy. Rhagoh's been letting\nhimself be haunted by the past for years. What\na pathetic little brother...\nIt'd be a hell of a lot easier for us both if he'd\njust forget about me and move on.\n...\nRush...? When did you get here?\nI was having a dream about my sister Kate.\nShe told me I should forget about her...\nBut\nthat was just a dream, right?
Oh, hello, Rush.\nI dreamt of my sister again, but she told me to\nforget all about her! How mean...
Rush! Thank you so much.\nThanks to you, I was able to be reunited with my\nother half...I was able to bring back Kate.\nI know she says I should have forgotten about\nher, but I'm certain that she's wanted me to\nsearch for her the whole time. Yes...I'm sure of it.\nAnd being tenacious enough to force herself\ninto my consciousness...that definitely seems\nlike Kate.\nRush, if it's alright, I'd like to continue to travel\nwith you. Kate does as well, of course. Please, let\nme know anytime you need something.
Hi, Rush!\nI fought with Kate for the first time in a long while.\nIt sounds kind of strange, but I really missed it...\nI didn't win, but then again I never have...
What...you looking for a fight?\nKeep gawking at me like that and I'll relieve you\nof your teeth.
What's your problem? You look like you've seen a\nghost. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I'm 100% flesh\nand blood, pal.
The hell's wrong with you? You look like you\nsaw a ghost.
Rhagoh?\nYeah, we're cool. Nothing for you to worry about.\nJust a bit ago we had a fight over lunch.\nObviously, I won.\nSo, of course we're fine. Isn't that what they say,\nfriendship is fighting like cats and dogs?\n...\nYeah, we're fine...we should be just fine, Rhagoh and me.
Rhagoh and me are getting along just fine.\nNothing for you to worry your empty little head about,\nanyway.
What do you want? I am not in a good mood. If you\nhaven't got a damned good reason to chit-chat,\nI suggest you leave me the hell alone.\n...\nSorry.\nIt's just that\nHell, I'll just tell you.\nThing is... I'm not really\nme. I mean, it's not like I'm\na clone or a ghost or anything ridiculous like that.\nHow it worked is that I'm the Kate from Rhagoh's\nmemories, made flesh by the Remnant Flâchonelle,\nif that makes any sense, which it probably doesn't.\nEither way, for the most part I'm really Kate, but still\nsort of...not.\nAt first, I didn't give a damn. If I was enough for\nRhagoh, it was enough for me.\nJust, as time's gone on, it's been freaking me out.\nI mean, what if everything I do isn't because I wanna\ndo it, but because I'm Rhagoh's idealized vision of me?\nWhat am I?\nWhat should I do with myself?\n...\nHuh...guess it's a bitch for you to have to deal with\nthis shit, too. But...thanks. It felt good to get some of\nthis off my chest.
Thanks for letting me vent. I feel better getting that\noff my chest.
Hey.\nSince we talked last time, I've been spending some\ntime away from Rhagoh... Been doing some thinking.\nIt was kinda nice to be away. Had me thinking I\ndidn't need to be worrying so much after all.\nI am me...and that's okay. Trying to force myself\nto act like somebody else wants is only gonna make\nall of us pissed, eh?\nSo, I'm just gonna live as me. Might be a little different\nthan what Rhagoh was thinking, but I am Kate and\nKate's gotta be true to herself.\n...Damn, but this is confusing. Anyway, thanks,\nRush. Talking with you really helped me sort\nall this out.
Heya, Rush!\nHuhhh, you actually look busy. We can chat later, then.

Welcome to the Sword of Three Realms.
To protect someone of my stature, obviously the most\nskilled of mercenaries are necessary.\nTo that end, I always take advantage of the guild here.\nThe high prices are no trouble for me\nI have enough\nmoney to bury the entirety of Lamberro in gold! Ha ha ha!
If the hiring fees look expensive, well, there're good\nreasons for that. I mean, a good merc's got a lot to\ntake care of. And I'm not just talking weapon skills.\nEquipment, arts, grace, fancy talk... Classy people are\nlooking for all of that before they hire you. It's kinda\nannoying...and pricey to keep up.

Ah, so you're looking to pick up some Guild Tasks,\ntoo? Eh\nyou don't think you can do 'em? Don't worry.\nI'll take you under my wing.\nIf it looks like it'll go well, then own it! If the going\ngets tough\nrun away! That is some number-one\ntop strategery right there, so don't you forget it!
Hey, have you heard? There's some new guild here\nin Lamberro where all the high-level mercs've\nbeen hanging out.\nThe rumor is that there's some secret entrance\nsomewhere in the Amber, but they only let the top\nof the top-class guys in. Guess I'll just stay here...
Different towns attract different types of adventurers\nto their guild.\nIf you aren't finding the type you're looking for here,\ntry checking a different town.\nOnce you visit a few other guilds, you'll understand.
You've heard about Siebenbur, right? It's a\nsprawling series of underground caverns...it's\nthe talk of all the adventurers lately.\nSome say it was built by one of the God\nEmperors, others say it was carved out by some\nmassive beast... No one knows for sure.\nOne of the reasons for that is that not so many\nreturn from Siebenbur\nin one piece, anyway.\nWhether you think you've got skills or no, be\nprepared if you end up going there. The monsters\nthere are nothing to sneeze at.

Hello! Welcome to the Amber Tavern.
Some strange animal or something has been seen\naround the stores on Grants Way. Ooh, if something\nlike that were to come here, I don't know what I'd do...
Some soldiers came here, looking for someone...\nIt wasn't you, was it?
Hmm? What's with that face?\nDid you get in a fight with someone?\nA lovers' spat, perhaps?
It seems those soldiers are back again. It seems they've\na message from the Marquis of Athlum... They're looking\nfor you, right? Come on, you can tell me.
You must be a popular guy...\nMessengers from Athlum are looking for you again.\nI figured you were just your run-of-the-mill cutie...\nDon't tell me you're one of Athlum's generals\nor something?
Poo...boring!\nI thought that by getting a job at the pub I'd be\nable to meet all kinds of cool people, but\neveryone who comes lives in the neighborhood!\nAhhh...it'd be pretty neat if Lord Qubine came\nhere for a drink, for example! Though, I guess\nhe's a little young...
The rumor going around Grants Way is that\nlots of soldiers have been gathering in Nagapur.\nYou don't think they're getting ready for a war\nor something, do you?\nEven if they were, my lovely tavernkeep, you\nhave no need to worry! I would protect you with\nmy life!
I cannot believe we were so easily overcome by\nthe Conqueror's army! Even so, the Conqueror's\nsoldiers weren't anything special, hm?\nOh! Fair bartender, my delicate bringer of\nspirits, did you see my stunning contribution\nto the city defense?\nYou saw me cowering under the counter?\nW-well! I wasn't feeling so well, you see! A bit\nof stomach flu, that's it! Really! Ahahah...hrm.
The Lords hold a meeting of the Congress every\ncouple years at the sacred city of Elysion\nyou\nknow, at the center of the continent.\nBut from here, it's a long, hard journey.\nIf you're planning on heading to Elysion, make\nsure you're stocked for a long trip.
You ever heard of Balterossa? It's a city in the\ndesert to the south. There you can buy weapons\nforged from all sorts of odd materials.\nYou should see the markets at least once in\nyour life, kid... At least, if you've the skill to\nmake it there in one piece.
The Conqueror's army seems to have two main leaders...\nOne's an armored giant, the other's a woman;\npretty, but with a tongue as sharp as her sword.\nTheir positions aren't for show, either\nthere\nisn't anyone who's been able to best them in\nbattle... I couldn't leave a scratch on them.\nThe two of them together put out this terrifying\naura, and leave behind a veritable mountain of\ncorpses on the battlefield...\nThose two...they're not ones to trifle with.
Did you see the kind of, er, rough yama sitting\nby himself downstairs?\nHe's one of our regulars, but unlike a lot of the\npeople here, he's traveled all over and knows a\nlot.\nIf you have any questions about other parts of\nthe world, try screwing up your courage and\nasking him, okay?\nI know he looks kinda scary, but he's really a\nsweet guy.
When the Conqueror attacked, lots of soldiers\ngathered here in Lamberro District on their way to\nthe battlefield.\nBut only a few returned... Alive, anyway...\nOh! But our yamaan regular, he made\nit back alright! Thank goodness...
You wish to know the powerful families in\nCelapaleis? Hmm...\nThe House of Nielsen, the House of Zita... Those\ntwo and the House of Gilles-Barre are the most\nwell-known, I believe.\nHowever, since rule of Celapaleis passed to\nLord Qubine, the Gilles-Barres have fallen into\na deep decline.\nTheir patriarch, Count Gierven, passed away some\nyears ago... It's said that was the reason for the\nHouse's fall.\nConversely, the Nielsens have risen in standing,\nespecially after Count Gierven's daughter was\nmarried into the family.\nWell. Even the high-born have drama, hmm?
Ooh... I've fallen, hard...\nFallen in love, of course!\nWith one of the Celapaleian guards... He's beautiful,\nhis eyes sparkle like the Umbermarici... I can't really\nsee under his helmet, but I just know it!\nBut for now, it's just a one-sided love... I'm so\nworked up I feel like I could burst! *sigh*
Ahh, I'm the happiest girl in the whole world!\nI asked out my crush, and he said yes!\nHe's one of the Celapaleian guards... His eyes sparkle\nlike the Umbermarici itself...but I'm the only one\nallowed to peek under his helmet.\nDoes everyone feel this blissful when they're in\nlove? If I could, I'd share some of my happiness\nwith you...
...\nFate is a cruel mistress.\nShe snatched him away from me, forever...\nBefore he left, he asked me to forget him if the\nworst happened...\nIdiot...\nAs if I could ever forget him...\nThis is his sword...the only thing of his that\nreturned from the battlefield. Would you take it?\nI was going to throw it away, but after talking to\nyou, I thought maybe you should have it...\nStrange, isn't it...
His sword will certainly help you protect your friends.\nI have to believe in that...
The gods have smiled upon me!\nMy beloved was dispatched to the Nest of Eagles,\nbut was able to return safely.\nHe said the army was devastated, but at the moment\nall hope seemed lost, Athlum swept in and turned\nthe tide.\nOh! Now that I think of it, his sword... I was on\nmy way to sell it, but instead, let me give it to you.\nHe's resigned from the army, and we're to be married!\nThis sword has protected my fiance all this time\nsurely it will be a blessing to you as well.
Oh, has the blade been useful? It protected my beloved\nfor a long time. Surely it will be a blessing to you as\nwell.
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...\nYou there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?\nYeah...why?\nYou're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...\nLord David put out a summons...he said he needed to\nspeak with you about something. Hurry to the\ncastle

Oho? But it is young Rush.\nI'm afraid I have no time to chat. I am to meet a\nmaiden as beautiful as a blooming rose.
Do you know the subcommander of the Order\nof Melphina, the fiery Ophelia?\nI hear she is quite unlike the stodgy old commander\ninstead, a beauty in the flower of youth, blazing with a\npassion for justice...and perhaps for other things as well.\nAhh, I should like to be the one to tame such a\ntigress. I wonder, is it difficult to join this Order\nof Melphina?
Ophelia, subcommander of the Order of Melphina.\nSomeday I shall make your acquaintance...and feel\nthe flames of your passion for myself.
Do you know the Lady Charlotte di Balterossa?\nShe is the lovely young heir to the desert\nqueendom.\nUnlike that arrogant harpy of a mother, Charlotte\nis a gentle and delicate flower...a true desert bloom.\nI wonder how I may pick that flower and raise it\nin a garden of my own...
The sweet princess, Charlotte di Balterossa...\nSomeday I will draw near enough to whisper sweet\nnothings into your ear...
Do you know the goddess of Elysion,\nMarion Marshall?\nNot even the legendary desert queen could compare\nto her greatness. It is said her beauty was enough\nto set even the most stoic of hearts atremble.\nIf only I could lay eyes upon her, even once...\nYea, time itself plots against our romance,\nyet I am certain I can find a way to surpass it...
The goddess of Elysion, Marion Marshall...\nIf only I could ford the streams of time to gaze\nupon your beauty...
The beloved daughter of Celapaleis' storied house\nof Gilles-Barre, Violet... She is noble as the rose.\nJust the sight of her fighting for the glory of her\nfamily, continuing the work her late father carried\nfor so long, moves my heart...\n...\nShall I be frank for a moment?\nI'm the third son of a poor family from Athlum.\nThere was no place for me in my home, so I\nfled at my first opportunity.\nHowever, on my own I realized I had little with which\nto make my way. As you know well, my skill lies not\nin acts of valor. My single talent is a pretty face.\nHeh, no need to look so surprised. Act how I may,\nI have a full understanding of the reality of my\nsituation. And I have taken advantage of it as well.\nThus I have made my way through the world by\npleasuring ladies and romancing maidens. Never\nhas one captured my heart.\nNever before now...\nViolet... For some reason I cannot keep her from\nmy thoughts. This has never happened before...\n...\nForgive my going on. If nothing else, this is no\nconversation for children.\nThough, I had imagined Baron Nielsen to be a\nbase cur, while in truth he is surprisingly\nbroad-minded... Ah, I must let it go.\nRush, forgive my candidness. I had not intended\nto speak of such odd things. Though, you are a\nsurprisingly good listener. It is appreciated.\nRush. Once again I pledge myself to your service.\nI promise to work to the best of my abilities. As for\nthe extent of those abilities, I make no guarantees.
Rush Sykes! A pleasure to see you once again.\nHave you need of me? If you've any troubles with the\nfairer sex, then you may request my services any time.
Absolutely nothing interesting is going on lately... *sigh*
You know Baron Nielsen, right?\nHis wife's run off again, can you believe it?\nThey really must not get along!
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ah, poor Baron. He's one of our regulars, you know.
Ooh, that priggish old guy with the mustache, huh?\nHe always fusses at me...
I don't want to believe it, but it seems like there's\nsome crazy woman plotting to assassinate\nLord Qubine...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I'd heard a similar rumor from Baron Nielsen...
What? What what?\nSounds fishy to me...
So, apparently the desert princess has been sneaking\nout of the castle pretty regularly to meet some\nguy she's been mooning over.

You just want an excuse not to come to work!
Seems relations between Balterossa and Royotia have\ntaken a nosedive. All the families of the soldiers are\ngetting worried since the armies are being mobilized...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
What about the poor princess? Wasn't she in love\nwith the boy from Royotia?
Guess they broke up.
So there's supposed to be something the Imperator\nsealed out in the great swamp... Problem is, the seal's\nbroken. Could be the entrance to some other world...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Some things are just meant to be left alone...\nNo need to be bringing all this up now, right?
Monsters are popping out of it!
There's a Forest Maiden who's so attuned to\nthe Knight she's bound to, she can like, see through\nhis eyes or hear things he's heard.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I'm bound to you, so let's go take a vacation!\nHmm? You really want to go now, yes?
No! Go by yourself!
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina\nare mobilizing... Seems something's happened to\nthe Last Leaf in Crookfen.

Whatever. If monsters want it so bad,\nlet them have it.
Irresponsible, much?
It's almost time for Kosmosfest! But apparently\nthe Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to Nagapur yet.\nSeems like maybe she's in trouble...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Why don't they just get a substitute maiden?
Do they have one?
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started\nthe Kosmosfest alright. Usually nothing much happens,\nbut this time it was interrupted by monsters.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Why not just let the monsters join in?
If it's a fighting festival, sure!
Some old-fashioned-looking woman is looking to hire\nbodyguards, I hear. She's supposed to be hanging\nout at the pub near the canal.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Hmm. There's a canal here in Celapaleis, but\nsomething makes me think this girl is in some\nother town.
Wait, what? We have a canal?
Hey, are you into antiques?\nApparently a lot of the treasures of the Old\nKingdoms are turning up on the black market.

Ack! They were from the pub!

Not the ones here, special ones!

Oh! That's surprisingly moving...
Recently people've been seeing this infamous bandit\naround Athlum. Apparently he's waiting around for\nsomeone but no one's brave enough to ask who.

Loki? Never heard of him.

I hope they catch him as soon as possible...
Me too. Ooh, scary...
There's some massive yama looking for stuff...\nBut he's kinda out there so people've been trying to\nkeep out of his way.

Yeah, I guess...\nI kinda feel bad for him though!
Some white qsiti's been looking for a magickal book.\nPeople seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's\nbeen able to place him.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Magick...that's that ancient, strange power, right?\nIt can't be learnt without a lot of study.
I want ancient powers! But I don't want to study...
There're these twins that've turned up as mercenaries\nlately...good ones, too. The one girl is supposed to be\na real cool customer\nboth in looks, and in attitude.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!

You realize that when you're switching off, you don't\nget paid, right?
Some guy out in the Great Sand Sea's been looking for\nchallengers for some sort of game\nbut he seems\nthe type not to deal with regular people.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Well then, let's not deal with him, either.

No one can cross the Great Sand Sea alone.
Huh? But what about this guy?

That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Men are fond of that sort of thing.
Yeah... It's pretty cool, don't you think?
The Honeywell family is known as a super-dedicated\nfamily. Some say that with their support you can\ndo anything.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Like General Emma, right? I met her once when I was\na child. She was beautiful.
She's pretty striking now!\nBut yeah, I wonder what she looked like when\nshe was young.
Apparently Athlum's General Torgal is supposed to\nhave some things in his past that're coming back to\nhaunt him. Stuff's supposed to be going on in Royotia...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Torgal is that sovani, yes?\nFor a sovani to serve a mitra, something significant\nmust have happened in his past...
Huh... Do you think he owes money?
It's about time for the Tournament of Heroes to start\nup again. It's pretty well-known among the types with\nfighting spirit.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ooh, those sorts of things are not for me.
But I bet I'd be okay, right?
Apparently there's some mystic academy that's been\nspitting out skilled magi for years.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Come to think of it, how's your homework\ncoming along?
It's...going? Sort of? Not really?
Athlum's been going through some tough times, and\npeople are worried about the new matriarch of\nthe Honeywell clan because she's so young.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!

Huh, so the young General Emma looked just\nlike General Emmy!
Recently there's been gossip about Lord David's\nlove interests...or lack thereof.\nHe's never been connected with anybody.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Really? I could swear there was that one person\na while back...
What? What? Really?\nIf you know something, you've gotta dish!
The old head of the Academy's been seen in pubs\nacross the continent lately. I guess it stands to reason\nshe'd want to drown her sorrows after what happened.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Really, what people should be asking is why she was\nin charge of the Academy in the first place...
The whole thing's pretty fishy.\nCPC_05PL_MP0:NPC:1Dr. Sykes has been seen going in and out of Athlum\nCastle lately. Maybe there's been some new discovery!

I heard that their son was staying at Athlum Castle.
Oh, guess he volunteered for the army, huh.
Some unidentified flying object's been spotted\nswooping around Wyrmskeep.\nIt's totally been freaking everyone out...

If it does, let's catch it!
Some hot-blooded female warrior is trying to hunt\ndown that group causing trouble in Crookfen.\nBut it's against her boss's wishes...

Yeah...\nSounds like she's doing it for herself more than\nanything...
Some monster army's appeared in the Great Sand Sea.\nThey're so powerful that everyone in Balterossa\nis totally in despair...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Goodness! What could possibly be going on?
Is the desert really gonna be okay?
According to ancient historians, there's something\ndangerous enough to destroy entire cities sealed\nwithin the volcano...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
And this has been kept secret all this time?\nWhy not tell everyone?
I guess they were hoping it'd stay sealed so it\nwouldn't matter.
No one knows anything about the stuff going on inside\nthe volcano, nor does anyone know how to find out...\nBut, the Marquis of Royotia might have some ideas...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Certainly the Marquis will have some sort of plan.
Wonder what it is? Probably "kill it with fire"!
You know there's a town without anyone running it?\nThe old ruler's sons are fighting over the seat of power.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Obviously they should just both rule.
If not, I'll do it!
When you're out in the desert, you can hear this sad,\nlonely voice crying from beneath the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Hey! You know I don't like those sorts of stories...
But it's interesting, don't you think?
A long time ago, there used to be a famed hero that\nlived in the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!

It is not!
So I was walking through town and heard this guy all\n"you gotta believe me! If you look at the pillars in\nthe Great Sand Sea, then...g-g-gra\n!"
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Hey! Enough with all that, already!
But it's funnn!
Some crackpot old scientist has been wandering\naround Melphina. If you go over there, you probably\nshould stay away, he's giving people strange looks.

Oh yeah, General Blocter busted the group, right?\nWonder if these are the same guys?
Adventurers have gotten into trading the different\ntreasures they find on their trips. Apparently,\nRoyotia's the main hub for the fad.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I'd never heard of that... Where is all this going on?
If they're using trade routes, probably mainly between\nBalterossa and Royotia, I'd say.
Royotian merchants are getting frustrated with\nBalterossa...they control all of their trade goods.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Definitely! Royotian things only get here after\npassing through Balterossa and Elysion, so they're\nalways incredibly expensive!
It'd be a lot easier if they came straight here,\nyou know?
Some yamaan mercenary's out looking for a partner.\nCould be a good way to make a few G.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
A mercenary hiring other mercenaries?
That's a pretty conservative yama, huh.
Some guy with a hot-and-cold personality's just\nshown up in Celapaleis. He'll seem really sweet and\nthen suddenly turn rough at the drop of a hat.

That's one of our customers, yes?
Yeah... He looked really sad, too...
There's some crazy qsiti going to crowded places and\nstanding in the way, and then picking fights with\npeople who run into him. What an annoyance...

Then, you are Rush Sykes, are you?\nI've heard a lot about you.\nFeel free to amply prepare yourself for your\ncoming battles here in Celapaleis.
The loss of General Honeywell and the Valeria\nHeart are both very regrettable... I offer my\ndeepest condolences.\nYet, had you not gone to the Nest of Eagles, all\nof Celapaleis would have been in grave danger.\nI cannot begin to describe my appreciation for\nwhat you've done.
I've not been feeling well of late...\nIt must be due to the debacle with Nagapur. I\nsuppose cleaning up that mess was more tiring\nthan I thought... Either way, it's nothing to worry about.
Ahh... For me to be in such a state... Keep this a\nsecret from Ghor, would you? I'm certain the old\nbat would never let me hear the end of it.
So Hermeien was behind the escalation of\nthe Remnants' powers...\nI didn't even dream it could be him.\nI still have so much to learn...\nGhor will never let me live this down, will he?
The future of Athlum lies in your hands.\nThe God Emperor is not a man to be trifled with.\nDo not let down your guard before him.
There are two paths to take.\nOne path allows you to be the creators of a new world.\nThe other brands you as traitors to the God Emperor\nas you are slain mercilessly by his followers.\nShow me what you have chosen.

Lady Emma reports that your talisman holds a\nmysterious power.
Yeah, it does.\nWhat? You think she's lying?
Lady Emma is an honest person.\nI have no reason to doubt her.\nSo this power...\nCan it be used outside of battles?
What do you mean?
Can you show me its power now?
Hmm, I dunno.\nI can try, though.
Wh-what just happened!?
I see...\nIt holds the power to manipulate time.\nProper application of such a power would give a clear\nadvantage when battling monsters, as well as allow\nyou to engage many foes in battle at once.\nHowever, it is almost certain that such a power cannot\nbe applied indefinitely. Use it wisely.
The door is sealed shut.

Are you lost, my boy?\nNot to worry\nthat happens all of the time.\nUp above is the\nRemnant Elysion\n. Beneath that\nlies the ivory structure of the assembly hall, and\nnumerous esteemed temples.\nThe city is a sanctuary for many.\nBut don't let an old man like me bore you with his\nstories. Why not take a look around for yourself?
My, my, what was that all about?\nMarching troops into this sacred town.\nSome folks have no decency.

See the cloud spiraling towards the heavens?\nThe Sacred Lands rest up there.\nIt used to be that when someone was talking about\n"Elysion," that's what they meant. Nowadays the name\nrefers to this town as well.\nI know I'm just a security guard, but someday I hope to\ngo up there!
Hey, did you see that!?\nA really bright light just flashed across the sky from the\nArk up towards the Sacred Lands!\nIf only I'd been in the Ark... I could've gone up to the\nSacred Lands, I bet...
I know who that was\nthe Conqueror and his\narmy.\nI figured they'd be a bunch of disorganized thugs, but\nthey were pretty impressive-looking.\nAnd that woman soldier, the one who gave that speech?\nWhat a looker! I wish she was my commanding officer...

Since Chairman Hermeien passed away, people\nhave been filled with nothing but uncertainties.\nSo, in times like this, my job as a protector of the\npeople is even more important, right?\nThis isn't the time to indulge in selfish dreams of\ngoing to the Sacred Lands.

The best selection of weapons, armor, and items\ncan be found here on Tula Street.\nOh, I know that some people go on and on about that\nHendler area, but I'd stay away if I were you.\nEverything they sell is just overpriced rubbish!
I saw it with my own two eyes!\nA flash of light shot straight from the Ark\nup to the heavens!\nI wonder what that was. All I know is that it was\nmuch brighter than the usual light the Ark emits\nwhen in use.
So that's the infamous Conqueror.\nI hear he's bad news, causing trouble\neverywhere he goes.\nWhat an evil glare he has!\nI hope he leaves our town peacefully...and soon!
Everyone in this part of the holy city is in\nsuch low spirits with the death of Chairman\nHermeien and the downfall of the Academy.\nIt seems the old folks in the temple district\nhave much more zest nowadays.

Hmph! Make sure you have the right\nperson next time!
S-sorry...

Hm? You again.
Uh.
You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!\nSay, ol\nO beautiful young maid, what're you doing\naround here?

Thank you.
You're not as inconsiderate as I thought.
You're looking well.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
Could you please not call me that?\nIt sounds ridiculous, to say the least.

Nice to meet you for real, finally.\nI'm

Wha\n? How did you know!?
I have my ways.
Take care, Rush.

Hey, Rushie!\nI'm having a fab time in town!\nThis place is like heaven!
Rushie, do you believe in witches?\nThey're women with the ability to, like,\nuse special powers, like magick.\n...\nYou have no idea what magick is, do you...?\nThen I guess you wouldn't know anything\nabout the Witch's Signet.\nSigh!\nYou need to, like, read more books\nor something. Useless!
Rushie, you need to, like, read more\nbooks or something. Useless!
You know how I was talking about witches\nbefore? Maybe I can try to, like, explain\nit a little. I'll tell you what my grandma told me.\nSo a really, really long time ago, there was\nthis thing called magick. It was nothing like\nthe spells we use where you need an object.\nWith magick, you can even rip through dimensions\nand stuff, or summon monsters!\nScientists and people still talk about it today!\nSo a witch is a female who can like,\ntotally use magick!\nI'm supposed to be, like, a descendant or\nsomething of a clan that has these powers.\nYou don't know anything, do you?\nI'm so exhausted!\nI'll tell you the rest later.
I'm supposed to be, like, a descendant or\nsomething of a clan of witches!
Anyway, so to continue my story...\nWhen you're part of a family with these\nkinda powers, they make you like, go\nout and train when you're young.\nSo that's what I'm doing right now.\nI need to, like, get this thing called the Witch's\nSignet. It's...somewhere in this world.\nI'm so totally over this training, so I want\nto find it ASAP and be done with it!\nSo, Rushie, will you help me find this thingy?
I'm so totally over this training!\nI want to find the signet ASAP and be done\nwith it all!
Thanks a million for helping me find\nthe Witch's Signet, Rushie!\nOkay, so I made a decision.\nI'm going to become a witch!\nAccording to the signet, the job of, like, a true\nwitch is to discover the world's truths!\nI figure I can travel the world to learn more\nabout magick and stuff. And maybe I can\nbecome a real witch!\nI'm gonna wait to tell Grandma I found\nthe signet. I'm gonna become a kickass\nwitch and surprise her one day!\nSo Rushie, I'll be seeing a lot of you.\nLucky you!
Heya, Rush!\nWhat's the 411?

Are you lost?\nThis is Hendler, the market area.\nYou can find all sorts of great stuff here.\nEverything's kind of expensive, but it's only\nbecause we sell the best!\n...Unlike what they sell at the frumpy shops on\nTula Street. I would stay away from that area\nif I were you.\nThis place usually isn't so packed, but there's a\nCongress meeting taking place soon. Hence,\nthe crowd.

Everyone's looking so down lately because\nof what happened in Nagapur.\nIf the Conqueror's army is still out there,\nElysion will probably wind up a warzone...\n...Now I'm dispirited, too!\nI don't even feel like shopping anymore...

Our town has no lord. It is run by\nthe chairman of the Congress, a position\nrotated by the representative of each land.\nBut in reality, the man with the most\npower ends up getting the job.\nThe position has gone to Lord Hermeien\nof Nagapur for the past few years.\nRumor has it that he's using his authority\nto conduct some experiments at the Academy\nsomething about creating new weapons.

Duke Ghor took over the Congress after\nChairman Hermeien's passing.\nThe Academy is going downhill, though.\nThe silver lining is the banning of Hermeien's\nillegal Remnant experiments. Now they only\nundertake legitimate research.

Many important folk pass though here.\nWhy, you ask?\nThe row of glamorous buildings over there\nare actually embassies of each state.\nBe careful\nif you act too suspiciously,\nthey might arrest you.
The embassy big-shots are in a flurry.\nWhy, you ask?\nDid you miss that flash of light?\nI think something snuck into\nthe Sacred Lands!

The shop owners are down in the dumps.\nWhy, you ask?\nThe shops in this market used to be\nfunded by the Congress.\nBut now that Chairman Ghor is in charge,\nthe administrative types from Hermeien's\nreign are gone.\nOh, well... I guess it wasn't fair that\nour town was getting special treatment\nin the first place.
Are you ready?\n'Course!\nUm, not just yet.
Alright. Hurry it up.\nCome back to me when you're ready.
Alright. Let us leave.\nBe on your toes\nwe're going to\nencounter a lot of monsters.
Oh, it's you.\nDid you want something?
I left my hometown and its dumb, outdated\ntraditions to come to the great city of Elysion.\nWith my incredible and awe-inspiring skills, I can\nwork as a mercenary and save up a bunch of cash\nin no time!
I left my hometown and its outdated traditions\nto come to the great city of Elysion.
The vow made between a maiden and a knight standing\nin front of the holy chalice is a power strong enough\nto protect the country.\n...Or at least that's what the saps back home believe.\nBut not me, no way!\nA true man can't buy into that kind of bullshit.\nThat's right\nbullshit!
The vow made between two people can\nbe strong enough to protect a country!?\nWhat a load of bull!
The thing is... I used to have this childhood friend.\nShe was a sickly little crybaby, but with a real heart of\ngold. Ever since I was a kid I'd looked out for her.\nAnd once I was old enough, we promised to make\nour vow in front of the holy chalice\nthe vow\nbetween a maiden and a knight.\nBut...okay. So, yeah, I know I'm not the classiest guy\naround. And maybe I've made a few mistakes, acted\nout a couple times\nfor good reasons, I might add!\nEither way, to err is qsiti, to forgive divine, right?\nWell, guess that saying's just pretty talk, 'cause\nI couldn't get accepted as a knight.\nI kept trying, but her illness just kept getting\nworse. She died before we could make our vow.\nShe left this world, disappointed in me, all\nbecause of that stupid tradition.\nSo I smashed the holy chalice!
I was supposed to make a vow with\na friend but she died, disappointed in me.\nIf there hadn't been that stupid tradition, then...\nDammit!
So... Deep down, I know that no matter how old and\nstupid they may be, blaming tradition for everything\nisn't right.\nIt was my own fault that I couldn't become a knight\nbefore she died. I just didn't want to face the truth,\nso I took it out on something else.\nIt just hurts so much to think of how I let her\ndown...\nBut I've gotta face my demons. I've gotta start\nliving a life that I can be proud of\nthat she would\nbe proud of.\nThanks for listening, Rush.\nI can see clearly now.\nI can't dwell on the past anymore.\nI owe you one.
Rush, I'm not going to dwell on the past\nanymore. I'm going to live a life that\nshe and I can be proud of. Thanks again!

Elysion is referred to as the capital of\nthe world, not because of its size, but\nbecause it's home to the Academy.\nUncovering the truth about Remnants means\nuncovering the biggest truth ever to exist.
I just saw a bright light shoot straight from\nthe Ark to the Sacred Lands.\nThat couldn't have been the work of the Academy.\nWas it possible that someone snuck in to abuse\nthe Ark?\nBut the Ark is already bound...\nThis doesn't make any sense.
Message 3
Rumor has it that Chairman Hermeien was\nusing his powers to secretly research a way\nto turn Remnants into weapons.\nWhen that fell through, people began\nto leave the Academy.\nOne of the reasons may have been the passing\nof the late Chairman, but the biggest reason\nwas due to the Gwayn's actions.\nAfter the destruction it caused, everyone\nmust have realized that Remnants\ncan't be truly controlled by anyone.
This area is off-limits.

Lord David, please allow me to escort you\nto the assembly hall.

Hello, Rush!\nIs everything well?
I don't know why, but I feel comfortable\nhere. I guess there are a lot of good\nmemories.\nI know it must sound weird to you,\nsince they fired me from the Academy.
I feel comfortable here.\nI have some good memories at the Academy.
Even though I've left the Academy,\nI still wonder about Remnants and\nwhat they really are.\nIf we can discover their true powers,\nwe might be able to use them to stop\nthe ongoing war in this world.
If we can discover the true powers of\nRemnants, we might be able to use them\nto stop the ongoing war!
Remnants provide us with knowledge\nand enhance our lives in many ways.\nThey are the world's greatest treasure.\nBut lately, I've been beginning to think\nthat we were never meant to use or\nbenefit from their powers.\nThe sad truth is that the world has\nbecome reliant on Remnants, which\nseem to have a part in everyone's lives.\nWe've spent centuries trying to understand\nwhat makes them tick, but we've gained very\nlittle knowledge.\nRush, maybe we were wrong to have\ntaken control over these divine objects.
Maybe we weren't meant to benefit\nfrom the powers of Remnants.\nIf that's the case...
Rush, I've thought about some things.\nI haven't been able to find answers to all\nof my questions, but I did figure out something.\nRemnants reflect our morality.\nIf we make poor choices, their powers\nreflect that.\nI want to find a way we can coexist\na way for us and Remnants to be happy.\nI want to travel the world and discover\nmore of what's out there.\nI may find the answers I need.\nI hope I can find what I'm looking for\nwhile helping you out with your journey.
Rush, I want to find a way for us to\ncoexist peacefully with Remnants.\nI hope we can work together to find answers.

Welcome to the Academy.\nI am Haruko, the director.
You're Rush Sykes?\nI'm so sorry I can't let you\nsee your parents...\nI'm Haruko, director of the Academy.
Don't tell anyone I told you...\nDoctors John and Marina Sykes are off in the\nSacred\nLands\nfor a routine evaluation.
It will be a while before anyone can get in touch with\nthem, because you have to use the\nRemnant Ark\nto get\nup there.\nUnfortunately, once the Ark is used, you need to wait\nseveral months before you can use it again.
Your parents are in the Sacred Lands for a routine\nevaluation.\nThey can't be reached for a while.
I'm sorry I can't let you see your parents...
Welcome to the Academy.
Welcome to the Academy.\nHow may I help you?
Ummm...\nI'm here to see Doctor Sykes.\nNever mind.
I'm sorry, but the doctors are in the middle of some\nextensive research and cannot be disturbed at this time.
The Academy strives to make the world a better place\nby spreading the fruit of our labor to every corner of\nthe world.\nWe are never to inject our personal feelings into any\nmatters here.
The laboratory is off-limits to non-Academy members.
I worked with John on a previous project.\nHe's very down-to-earth and kind, especially\nconsidering that he's one of the best scientists working\nat the Academy.\nHe's a family man, too. He has a picture of his family\non his desk that he's always staring at.
What? The Ark was activated?\nThat's impossible.\nIt's bound to a member of the Academy.\nMeaning, it can only be activated by a member of the\nresearch team that was hand-picked by the Academy.\nYour eyes are just playing tricks on you.
Since the new Congress came into office, all the\nscientists closest to Duke Hermeien have left the\nAcademy.\nThanks to all this change, I have less say and less pay.\nBut ehh, I guess I'll stay and continue my research.\nAnything to help John, now that he's back and feeling\nbetter.
You're looking for a Remnant that takes you\nto the Sacred Lands?\nI've heard stories of another Ark-like Remnant\nexisting outside of Elysion.
What happens if a town loses its Remnant, you ask?\nAs far as I know, the land returns to its normal state.\nHarsh winds dry out the earth and all of the vegetation\njust withers away.\nSometimes volcanoes erupt and burn down entire towns.\nOr rivers overflow and flood the lands.\nBut not all bad things will happen to every town.\nAfter all, there are towns that don't have Remnants.\nLike Eulam Island. I hear it's not supposed to be that bad\nof a place to live, even though it doesn't have a Remnant.\nSay, why the question?
I admire both of the Sykes. They're the most brilliant\nscientists working for the Academy.\nBut they win my respect because they're both opposed\nto the weaponization of Remnants.\nI hope I get to work with them someday!
...The Ark was activated!?\nHow could that be?\nOnce a Remnant's been bound, it can't be activated\nby anyone else until the bind is broken.\nWe all learned that in Remnants 101.\nDoes that mean that...what we've been taught is wrong?
After Lord Hermeien passed, the Academy underwent\nsome changes. Even Director Haruko was fired.\nShe was so passionate and involved in the research.\nShe was a great director...\nThen, a bunch of other people picked up and left of\ntheir own free will.\nI plan to stay, though, with the Sykes.\nI need to find a way to prevent what happened in\nNagapur from happening again.
The Hermeiens were placed in charge of all Remmants\nonce used by the Imperator.\nThe late Chairman Hermeien is the only soul I can\nthink of that would have had knowledge of what you\nare looking for.
The previous director was an old fogey appointed way\nback by the previous Congress Chairman.\nHe was very pushy and overbearing, always tried to\nkeep things to himself. Not many of us liked him.\nThere were always rumors flying around about him\ncausing problems behind the scenes... Everyone thinks\nthis latest personnel shuffle was meant to shut those up.
Everyone around town is talking about how the Ark\nwas activated.\nThe legendary Marion Marshall is the only one I've\never heard of who can overwrite bindings of Remnants.\nPerhaps she's come back to us...
The late Duke Hermeien was doing unmentionable things\nusing the Academy as a cover.\nThe weaponization and duplication of Remnants...\nIt saddens me to think that my fellow scientists were\nsuch unethical people.\nI'll stay and find a way, though\na way for us to\nuse Remnants for the good of the world.
The Ark was discovered by the Imperator.\nPerhaps there are similar Remnants in the lands\nhe has visited?

Straight ahead is the Remnant Ark.\nThe Academy has the ability to send a\nselect few to the Sacred Lands\nseveral times a year.\nThe Remnant that Marion Marshall\nbound to herself is the Sacred Lands,\nthe mass of rock above.\nThe Sacred Lands is where our souls\ngo to rest when we pass away\nit is even referred to as a heaven.
Wh-what happened?\nWh-where am I...?\nI was... I was talking about the Sacred Lands...\n...and I don't know what happened\nafter that...\nDo you know what just happened here!?
This area has become off-limits to civilians\nfollowing the incident at Nagapur.\nWhat a shame...
That light... So celestial...\nSeeing that was worth my trek here.\nI can cross this off of my list of things\nto do before I die.
That large man clothed in red touched\nthe Ark right before that light shot\nup to the heavens.\nWho was he?\nA reaper, perhaps?
So this is the Ark.\nI thought it would look more like\nsomething you ride.\nHow does this work exactly?
A bright light shot out of the Ark\na second ago. I think it means that\nman bound the Ark to himself.\nI wonder how he did it.\nThis Remnant is huge!

Welcome to the Heavenly Terrace.\nWhat would you like to know about?\nThe neighboring cities\nThe Academy\nYou
Elysion's central location makes it simple to travel to\nmany places from here. As for places worth visiting...\nHmm, let's see.\nBalterossa, a large trade city to the southwest, has\na huge population and a great selection of goods.\nOoh, and there's Royotia, a mining town south past the\ndesert. The area is famous for quality ore.\nLet's see... What other places are out there?\nYou should go see for yourself!
The Academy is a Remnant research facility found near\nthe assembly hall.\nThe Academy is heavily backed by the Congress.\nChairman Hermeien's obsession with Remnants borders\non unnatural.\nHe invests a lot of money to keep the Academy afloat.
Come back in ten years, cutie, when you've grown into\na real man\nand I'll tell you anything you want to\nknow then. Anything. *wink*
Now that you've heard all about the other towns, it might\nbe a good time to go and see them with your own eyes.
Oh, I almost forgot!\nFar to the southeast of Elysion is Melphina,\nthe town of scholars. I hear it's a beautiful\ntown surrounded by nature.\nIf only I could get a day off. I'd love to go\nto Melphina and see for myself.
The Academy is the building across from the assembly\nhall. With support from the Congress, they research\nRemnants.\nUnder Duke Hermeien, there was some illegal\nexperimentation going on there, but all that's stopped\nsince the Duke of Ghor became Congress chairman.\nIt's become a decent organization again.
You want directions to other towns?\nListen carefully, sonny.\nThe\nSouthwestern Road\nto the desert is used as a trade\nroute, but any merchant traveling that road takes plenty\nof protection\nand with good reason.\nThat place is crawling with monsters!\nIf you value your life, you won't take that road. Capice?
The army that was making a scene\non Tula Street... What was their business?\nThat lady was a looker, though, huh?\nBut where in the world is Veyriel?\nI know my geography and I've never heard\nof the town!
There are strongholds around Elysion that were built to\nprotect this city from invaders. Of course, they haven't\nbeen used for hundreds of years.\nBut lately...there have been rumors of suspicious folks\nhanging around them.\nI don't know who's up to what, but it can't be good!
There are plenty of goodies to buy in Elysion, but I really\nrecommend the Blessed Buns.\nThey're soft and feathery on the outside, like clouds,\nwith a creamy filling, like the Remnant Elysion floating\nwithin them.\nOne bite will take you to heaven\nor the Sacred Lands.\nGetting hungry?\nThey're sold in Hendler if you want to go home with\na pack or ten!
Hey, listen up.\nI heard rumors of people hanging around the strongholds\nat night and I decided to check it out for myself.\nThat's when I saw Lord Hermeien, who supposedly died\nin the war!\nI've told a few people but no one believes me.\nBut I know what I saw!
You've been thinking about that too, eh?\n...Don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking\nabout! The barkeep!\nThe white lab coat she used to wear...\nThe blond hair that shines like the sun...\nFiery almond-shaped eyes full of life...\nYou're thinking of going after her, aren't you!? Well,\nyou should give up now. You know why?\nIf the research that my brother's doing in Melphina is\nsuccessful, she'll fall head over heels in love with me!\nHahaha!
You thought so, too, did you?\nThat army that came around talking about\ndreams and such... It all has to be a ruse by\nsome lowly lord to get invited to the Congress.\nThat big guy in the armor must have been\nthe Conqueror, but he didn't emanate\na single ounce of intelligence or leadership!\nThis all has to be one big joke...
You've been thinking about that too, eh?\n...Don't look at me like you don't know\nwhat I'm talking about! The strongholds!\nRumor has it that shady-types have been seen using\nthem lately. Me, I think it's a bunch of ex-Academy\nmembers doing some sort of "private" research.\nMe and my brother used to do all kinds of experiments\nwhen we were young... Hahaha!
The new Academy director, Ms. Haruko, is very skilled as\na scientist, but I'm not sure she has the management\nskills to run the whole Academy.\nShe was probably put in that position temporarily, and\nwill soon be replaced by someone else\nperhaps\nJohn Sykes.
Ahh, the Academy's done for.\nOnce the Congress found out Hermeien had a group\ndoing underground Remnant research, not only did they\ndisband it, but they cut funds for the rest of us as well.\nYou can guess how well that went over... The only\nscientists left are the ones who are really passionate\nabout what they do.\nI think I'm on my way out, too. I guess I'll go back home\nand marry the man my parents picked out after all.
I hear there's some unknown army making use of the\nabandoned strongholds near Elysion.\nThey're not using just one, but several of them.\nIt...couldn't be the Conqueror's army, could it?\nI was so certain they'd all perished in Nagapur...\nOh, I don't even want to entertain the thought!
Hehe, my days are so lax.
Then you're fired.
Hehe, my days are so busy.
You know Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis? Seems his\nwife's disappeared. ...'Course, those two are famous\nfor not getting along, so it's nothing new.
Interesting, huh?
Why does he put up with that?\nThat is NOT acceptable behavior.
I heard someone's plotting to assassinate\nDuke Qubine... Rumor has it a suspicious-\nlooking woman was spotted lurking about.
Interesting, huh?
And the idiots didn't bring her in for questioning?
So, apparently the desert princess has been\nsneaking out of the castle pretty regularly to\nmeet some guy she's been mooning over.
Interesting, huh?

If people know it's coming, why don't\nthey do something to try to stop it\nfrom happening? Lazy bastards...
...Easier said than done.
Rumor has it that in a certain moor,\nthe Imperator used his powers to\nseal the entranceway to another realm.
Interesting, huh?
What a useless bastard. Why didn't\nhe just destroy it to save us grief?
...I think he would have, if that had\nbeen an option.
If a Forest Maiden vows eternity with\na Melphinian knight, she gains the power to\nsee and hear whatever her partner does.
Interesting, huh?
That has got to be annoying!\nEveryone needs their alone time.\nUgh, I could never do that.
...Don't worry\nno one will ever ask you to.
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina\nare getting ready for something big. I think something's\nhappened to the Last Leaf in Crookfen.
Interesting, huh?
See? I was right! The Imperator IS\na useless bastard! This wouldn't have\nhappened if he had destroyed the damn thing!
...Why don't you go back in time\na thousand years and tell him?
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, huh? But apparently\nthe Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to Nagapur yet.\nMaybe she got mixed up in something.
Interesting, huh?
She's probably just taking her sweet\ntime getting ready.\nWomen are so vain!
...You're not?
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started\nthe festival alright. Usually it's a pretty quiet event\nuntil the monsters show up.
Interesting, huh?
It's a festival! Lighten up!\nMonsters? The more the merrier!
...You're happy as long as they buy\ntheir refreshments here, right?
Some old-fashioned-looking woman is looking to\nhire bodyguards, I hear. She's supposed to be\nhanging out at a pub near the canal.
Interesting, huh?
Only weaklings need bodyguards.
...Not everyone is as strong as you.
Apparently, a lot of the treasures of the Old Kingdoms\nare turning up on the black market.
Interesting, huh?
Out with the old, in with the new.
...I don't think that applies here.
Some guy is looking for these three stones that\nplay an important part in the desert's history.
Interesting, huh?
Someone's looking for stones?\nThere's a bunch in the back,\nif anyone needs any.
Some guy researching the history of ancient magick\nis looking for a little help. Maybe he can uncover\nthe secrets we've always wanted to know...
Interesting, huh?
Ooh! Maybe he can make me a love potion!
Apparently, some monster sealed by the Imperator\nhas appeared. It's really got people spooked, saying\nit's the end of the world!
Interesting, huh?
Are we all going to die?\nIf that's the case, I'm going to withdraw my\nlife savings and go on a shopping spree!
...What are you going to do if\nnothing happens and we're fine?
Some amnesiac is wandering around the cities\nin the desert, looking for anything to help\nregain his memory.

Don't worry. At your age, you'll be losing your memory\nsoon enough.
A notorious bandit is lurking around Athlum.\nIt seems he's waiting for someone but no one's\nbrave enough to ask.

...Are you crying!?
There's a murderer on the loose in the big city!
Interesting, huh?
What!?\nHere!?
There's some massive yama looking for stuff.\nHe's acting kinda weird, though. People say\nhe's crazy.
Interesting, huh?
He's a yama, of course he's large.\n...Anyway, I hope he comes here!
...Looking to make a profit, are you?
Some white qsiti's been looking for a mystical book.\nPeople seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's\nbeen able to place him.
Interesting, huh?
I've never liked the bookworm type.\nHe should go out and get some sun.
There's this set of twins that've turned up as\nmercenaries lately...good ones, too. They're slightly\ncold in attitude, but everyone wants to meet them!
Interesting, huh?

Some fellow is hosting a game in\nthe Great Sand Sea. I wonder how\nmany people are gonna join in the fun.
Interesting, huh?

...You are every man's nightmare.
A bunch of guards somewhere have sworn to\nfollow their ruler for as long as they live.
Interesting, huh?
If I were lord, I would work them\nlike my slaves.
There's not a family in the world as dedicated as\nthe Honeywells. If they've got your back,\nyou can relax.
Interesting, huh?
I wonder if they've got my back.
I heard in Royotia that apparently\nTorgal of the Athlum generals is real\ntouchy about his past.
Interesting, huh?
Everyone has a touchy part of their\npast. Some things I'll take with me\nto the grave.
..Don't worry. No one's interested in\nyour past, anyway.
The competition to determine the Hero Exemplar\nis about to start. I wonder how many are gonna\nbe up for the challenge.
Interesting, huh?
Yeah, good luck. Not interested.
I hear Mystic Arts Academy is a renowned school\nand its graduates go on to do great things.
Interesting, huh?
With that kind of education, I bet\nthe graduates rake in the big bucks.
Athlum's had its share of hardships, and with\nthe new Honeywell girl being so young...\nWell, people are worried.
Interesting, huh?
She'll do fine.\nI have faith.
...Was that a compliment? From you?\nWhat's wrong with you today?
A lot of the ladies are wondering why the Marquis\nof Athlum has no lady in his life.\nI can't see why\nhe's a good-looking fella.
Interesting, huh?
Who's to say he doesn't?\nOoh! I wish I could find out.
The ex-director of the Academy has been\nspotted at pubs in various cities.
Interesting, huh?
She should come here!\nI've always liked her!
...You just like her money.
It seems Dr. Sykes has been seen making frequent\ntrips to Athlum Castle lately.
Interesting, huh?
Dr. Sykes?\nI used to work under her.
...You worked for the Academy?
A monster was spotted flying around Wyrmskeep.\nIt's got the town spooked!
Interesting, huh?
I wish a lot of things would go away,\nbut there are just some things you\nhave to live with.
Some bloodthirsty female warrior is trying to hunt down\nthe goons responsible for the incident at the moor,\nagainst her boss's wishes.
Interesting, huh?
I wish some hottie would hunt ME down.
...Keep on dreaming.
A mob of ferocious monsters were spotted\nin the Great Sand Sea. They're apparently so\npowerful that Balterossa doesn't know what to do.
Interesting, huh?
Drama!\nI should go have a looksie.
...You're a loon.
According to archaeologists, there's something\ndangerous enough to destroy entire cities\nhidden in the depths of a volcano.
Interesting, huh?
How scary!\nBut how much can you really trust\na weatherman's prediction?
...They're archaeologists, not meteorologists.
No one knows what's going on inside the volcano.\nBut lords have their ways of finding things out\nno matter how impossible.
Interesting, huh?
How would a lord know something\na scientist doesn't even know?
...They have their ways.
A certain town just lost their lord, and\nhis two sons are fighting for the position.
Interesting, huh?
This has nothing to do with me.\nI don't care.
...I'm sure they don't care about you, either.
They say that if you listen closely, you can\nhear crying coming from the depths of\nthe Great Sand Sea.
Interesting, huh?
Crying? Someone's hurting?\nHow...tragic...
...Are you laughing?\n...You're laughing, aren't you?
A long time ago, a hero lived in the Great Sand Sea.
Interesting, huh?
And?
...I don't know.
Some guy got the wits scared out of him in\nthe Great Sand Sea. He was talking to a pillar\nwhen ghosts appeared out of nowhere.
Interesting, huh?
Guys who talk to pillars scare me more\nthan ghosts.
...True.
There's a man claiming to be a scientist\nin Melphina. Apparently, we should stay away\nfrom him because he's absolutely looney.
Interesting, huh?
Oh, that guy.
...A friend of yours?
There's a cafe in some city that's infested\nwith bugs from the desert. I hear the owner\nis about to go crazy!
Interesting, huh?
How unsanitary.\nI'm never going there.
Since the incident, Nagapur's become a real\ndangerous area. There's lots of crime, especially\ninvolving the kidnapping of young boys and girls.
Interesting, huh?
Kidnapping? Missing children?\nThat's just wrong!
A trend started in Royotia, where people would\nexchange treasures they found on their adventures.\nNo one does that anymore, though.
Interesting, huh?
They would exchange treasures?\nThe only thing I would exchange\ntreasure for is cash.
Balterossa is the sole buyer of all of\nRoyotia's trade goods. There are countless merchants\nwho aren't too happy with the situation.
Interesting, huh?
I'm sure they're being resold at a reasonable\nprice, unlike the inflated price tags\nthe merchants would put on them.
...You just made enemies with every\nmerchant in the world.\nERC_05PL_MP0:NPC:1A yamaan mercenary is looking for soldiers to\nhelp him out. I bet he found himself a job too big\nto take on alone.
Interesting, huh?
Mercenaries don't have a steady earning.\nHe needs to change careers.\nDeskwork is always a good option.
...With the ongoing feuds, I'm sure\nthey get paid better than you do.
I heard some girl raving about a man in Celapaleis\nwho's sweet one second, but then angry the next.\nShe says he's her ideal man. Women...
Interesting, huh?
That's my ideal man, too!
...Really?
There's a qsiti who stands in the middle\nof busy streets and glares at anyone\nwho bumps into him. Weird.
Interesting, huh?
Oh, I know him.
...Another friend of yours?
There's this intriguingly mysterious lady\nwho looks like she has the weight\nof the world on her shoulders.
Interesting, huh?
I should try acting mysterious.\nMaybe then people will pay attention to me!
There was a bunch of Bloody Alice soldiers\nspotted at the moor. It looked like they were\ngetting ready to do something big.
Interesting, huh?
Those feminist bandits?\nI hope they get eaten alive by\nsome horrid monster.
The Jhana are now causing a ruckus in\nthe Great Sand Sea. Apparently, not even\nthe Gae Bolg can teach them a lesson.
Interesting, huh?
They never learn...\nJust like men.
...I resent that.
The Silver Falcons say they're going to get rid\nof the Jhana. They're so dependable.
Interesting, huh?
It's not really their fault they don't\nlearn. Their race survives by stealing\nfrom people. They don't think on their own.
...How do you know this?
The Silver Falcons are going to get\nrid of what's left of the Conqueror's army.\nGood riddance!
Interesting, huh?
Less soldiers means less customers...\nAh well.
A real gloomy-looking man comes here all the time.\nHe really creeps me out...
Interesting, huh?
I want to kick him out, but I have no real reason to.
...No one knows anything about him.

Seeing this statue, I can see\nwhy they want to believe she existed!
I think I've begun to understand why so many people\ncome to places like this.\nThe thought of some higher power like Marion Marshall\nwatching over us really gives a sense of relief and\nsecurity.
This is the resting place of souls.\nNo one may enter.
What? You wish to go through these doors?\nThe Marquis of Athlum...!\nWell, I can hardly say no to your lordship.\nI will unlock the doors at once.\nBut please refrain from telling anyone\nabout this, my lord.

Listen up, Rush.\nYou can have the upper hand if you initiate battles\ninstead of being ambushed.
Yeah, I know.
And it's always good to fight as many monsters as\npossible at the same time.
Why? That sounds dangerous.
The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward, that's what\nI say!

Who are you and why are you here?\nThis is the warrior town of Ghor.\nMany brave soldiers are gathered here, sworn to follow\nthe valiant Duke of Ghor.\nYou hail from Athlum!? That must mean you take orders\nfrom that toddler, Duke Qubine.\nIf you have no business here, I suggest you leave\nimmediately.
Message 2
Message 3
Message 4
Ever since the Duke of Ghor became Chairman,\nthe warrior town has been bustling!\nOur lord can guide even the most lost souls of this\nchaotic world down the right path.\nAs a citizen of this town, I want to do my part to\nhelp out in any way I can.
Damn the Conqueror!\nDo you know how many times I've stopped myself\nfrom taking the boys with me into his base and\nslaughtering them all? Argh!\nBut I need to stay calm, especially while the lord\nis out of commission.\nRight now, he's resting and needs to concentrate\non getting better.\nIn the meantime, I can't allow any suspicious\npersons into this town!
The lords of Ghor have been faithful servants to\nthe Hermeiens of Nagapur for the past three\ngenerations.\nIf anyone seriously tries to oppose Nagapur, the Ghor\ntroops will relentlessly set them straight.\n...Don't tell anyone this, but I think our lord is much\nmore competent than Lord Hermeien.
Message 2
Message 3
Message 4
I can't believe the lord of such a small town is now\nthe Chairman of the Congress!\nI guess anything can happen.\nOr maybe all the other cities have come to realize\nthe greatness that is our lord! Hahaha!
A long time ago, I challenged the Duke of Ghor for\nthe position of lord over this stronghold.\nThe duel was over in the blink of an eye.\nBut even as I was getting pummeled, I was awed to\nbe in the presence of one so strong.\nOur lord is the most ferocious warrior in all the\nlands.\nHe won't die easily.\nHe won't...!
Is this your first time here?\nIt's like a maze, isn't it?\nThis used to be nothing more than an abandoned\ncastle.\nEver since our lord made this place his home,\nstrong warriors from all corners of the world began\nto show up.\nWhich is how I ended up here as well.
Message 2
Being chosen as chairman of the Congress\nmust mean that our lord was deemed\nfit by all the other lords.\nEveryone's so excited!\nThat pub over there was even open\ntill dawn in celebration!\nWe will fight for our lord whom we\nbelieve in from the bottom of our hearts.
Message 4
Our town doesn't possess a huge Remnant\nlike the other towns.\nThough our lord does keep the Bilqis\nat his side.\nIt has the power to bring out the best\nin people\nthe powers they hold inside.\nThat big axe represents our lord's\npresence and the power he holds.\nI bet you can't find a fine weapon like\nthat anywhere else in the world.
Message 2
Have you been to Nagapur yet?\nI've seen the aftermath of many\nbattles, but never have I seen anything\nlike what I saw there.\nI'm a little worried. What if the Bilqis\nwere to do the same thing and cause\nthe same kind of destruction?\nA small stronghold like this would be\ndestroyed in mere seconds!
Message 4
Don't you agree that there's something\nsuspicious underneath?
Oh, hey.\nTaking off soon?\nNo? Then leave me alone.\nBut before you go...\nI think there's something hidden in this\ntown. The castle's almost fully repaired,\nbut there may be something underground.\nI'm getting an excavation team together\nto make the discovery of a lifetime!\nThe Arco Iris was a miracle, but\nit was our miracle and only ours...\nI want to discover something bigger!\nThis is going to take time and money,\nbut I promise to help out if you need me,\nif you stop pestering me during my free time!\nLater!
SIGH.\nWhen is this ever going to work out?
Do you have any jobs for me?\nNo?\nBut I need funds for my excavation team!\nPagus suggested I join a guild so\nI came here...and now he doesn't\neven show his face.\nEven the Arco Iris legend was his\nbaby to begin with. I don't even know\nhow I got involved!\nGrrr...
Grrr...\nNo progress...
Hey, Rush, good timing!\nI was just looking for you.\nI've been frustrated that my plan to\ncreate an excavation team wasn't working\nout, so I came up with a different plan.\nYou guys should be part of the team!\nI'll pay you for your troubles, I promise.\nThe area underneath Ghor Castle\nis really fishy... There's something there,\nI know it!\nI'll persuade Duke Ghor to let us\ninvestigate the area. So come on,\nhelp me out!
You guys should join my excavation\nteam! I'll ask Duke Ghor for permission\nto dig on his premises. What do you say?
Hey, Rush...\nI couldn't get permission from Duke Ghor...\nHe glared at me and I froze...\n...\nAlright, time to come up with another\nspot for excavation! There's a ton\nof ruins in this world.\nI'm not giving up that easily! In rough times\nlike these, you need something to keep\nyourself occupied. I'm giving people hope!\nSo, c'mon!\nLet's go make the discovery of a lifetime!
Rush! Are you ready yet!?\nLet's go make the discovery of a lifetime!
Huh?\nMaddox is wanted by the Celapaleian\narmy?\nLike I'd believe that!\nHe's a nice fella, but a paranoid\nold man.\nI mean, think about it.\nIf that were true, wouldn't\nAthlum be after him as well?\nWhat a crazy old coot!

Hey there!\nThe Den of Heroes here to serve you!
Hey there! The Den of Heroes here to\nserve you! I'm out of peanuts, so\nhow about a story instead?\nSouth of the desert lies Royotia,\na city in a dangerous mountainous region.\nEven though it's a small town, the people\nwho struggle to live there\ntheir hardship\nis burned into my memory forever.
You know why the gang in Nagapur can\nrest easy?\nIt's because of us!\nI don't think they see that.\nI feel like they take us for granted!
What a thing to happen to Nagapur...\nI can't help but feel sorry for them.
I thought Hermeien died during the incident\nwith the Gwayn, but I hear he's still alive\nand crazier than ever.\nI hope our lord doesn't feel like he\nhas to go head to head with that madman...
Hey, no shenanigans in my pub, you hear?\nOur lord is recuperating at the moment.\nWe pray for a quick recovery.\nI don't want to answer to some kid from Celapaleis!
Our lord is too noble for his own good.\nJust because he feels indebted to Lord Oswald,\nthe previous Nagapur leader, he shouldn't feel\nhe has to repay his gratitude to that punk Wilfred.
A whippersnapper like Wilfred Hermeien had no\nbusiness being Chairman of the Congress in the first\nplace.\nA fine, upstanding man with a strong sense of duty\nlike our own Lord Ghor is infinitely more suited for\nthe position.
I don't feel we owe anything to that Hermeien kid.\nI saw the look in his eyes when he came to speak\nwith our lord. Something wasn't quite right about him...\nI wonder if Ghor is prepared to throw away its\noutdated sense of duty and go against Hermeien\nif the need arises...\nOur lord is a good man, but sometimes he's too moral\nfor his own good.
Our lord is resting in his castle.\nI hear he's not doing very well.\nI'm filled with rage!\nI want to take the Conqueror's life\nwith my own blade!\nI know I could take him on if only I\nwere 50 years younger.
I spoke to the white yama and he told me\nabout a secret Blackdale entrance.\nHe held such fear in his eyes...
Sir! Nothing new to report, sir!
How many times do I have to tell\nyou, this isn't the army!?
Sir! Sorry, sir!
The wife of Celapaleis's Baron Nielsen has\nrun off, sir! They're famous for fighting like\ncats and dogs, so no surprise there, sir!

That would be genius, sir!
It seems something happened to the Last\nLeaf in Crookfen, sir! The Forest Maidens and\nthe knights of Melphina are taking action.
Sir! What do you think of this?

According to my sources, this year's Kosmosfest\nhasn't began yet because the Cosmos Maiden\nhas yet to arrive, sir!

The Cosmos Maiden has made it safely to the festival\nand it's about to begin, sir! It's a shame this tranquil\nevent is always disrupted by monsters.

I couldn't have said it better myself, sir!
There are no means to research the dangers\nthat lie within a volcano, sir. But lords have their ways\nof finding things out\nno matter how impossible.
Sir! What do you think of this?
Volcanoes and danger!\nMy two favorite things in the world!
I couldn't have said it better myself, sir!
There's a town somewhere without a lord, sir!\nI hear his two sons are fighting for\nthe position.
Sir! What do you think of this?
Fighting over power is useless.\nThose who are destined to rule over others\nwill naturally come to power.
I couldn't have said it better myself, sir!
According to my sources, if you listen closely,\nyou can hear crying coming from the depths of\nthe Great Sand Sea, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
I-I'm not good at dealing with\nanything supernatural...
Long ago, a hero wandered the Great Sand Sea, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
He's a man of the past.\nNow Duke Ghor is the hero of the times.
I couldn't have said it better myself, sir!
Someone claims that if you talk to the pillar\nin the Great Sand Sea, ghosts appear from nowhere, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
I-I hate ghosts!
There's a scientist in Melphina who everyone\navoids because he's absolutely crazy, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
I wonder what happened.
I think he did something horrible\nto someone, sir!
Desert bugs keep flying into the pub of a town\nnear the desert, sir, and it's driving the owner\ncrazy!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Swallowing a bug or two won't kill\nanyone!
You're absolutely right, sir!
Nagapur's become such a dangerous area since\nthe incident, sir! There's lots of crime, especially\ninvolving the kidnapping of young boys and girls.
Sir! What do you think of this?
I've got a knuckle sandwich for\nanyone who tries to hurt kids\naround here!
You tell them, sir!
A trend started in Royotia, where people would\nexchange treasures they found on their adventures, sir.\nNo one does that anymore, though.
Sir! What do you think of this?
This place is my treasure.\nI wouldn't give it up for all the money\nin the world.
Balterossa is the sole buyer of all of\nRoyotia's trade goods, sir, and there are lots of\nmerchants that aren't happy with the situation.
Sir! What do you think of this?
They might be disgruntled, but safety\nshould come first. It's better in the long run.
A yamaan mercenary is seeking help, sir!\nI bet he found himself a job too big to\nhandle alone.
Sir! What do you think of this?
A mercenary looking for help, huh?\nThis must be some job!
I expect so, sir!
There's a man in Celapaleis who's sweet\none second, but angry the next, sir.\nAnd apparently, women like that in a man!
Sir! What do you think of this?
He sounds like a kook to me.\nI'll never understand women and\ntheir taste in men.
There's a qsiti who stands in the middle\nof busy streets and glares at anyone\nwho bumps into him, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Take me to him.\nIf it's confrontation he wants, it's\nconfrontation he'll get!
There's a mysterious woman with what looks like\nthe weight of the world on her shoulders, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Maybe I should give it a shot...
A group of Bloody Alice soldiers was spotted\nat the moor, sir!\nThey must be getting ready to do something big.
Sir! What do you think of this?
They're hiding something.\nI know it. What could it be?
The Jhana are now causing trouble in\nthe Great Sand Sea, sir! Apparently, not even\nthe Gae Bolg can teach them a lesson.
Sir! What do you think of this?
I admire the Silver Falcons for sticking\nto their guns and doing what they believe\nin, though they scare me a little, to be honest...
According to my sources, the Silver Falcons are going\nto rid the area of the Jhana, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
We should let the Silver Falcons be,\nand support their efforts from afar.\nWe don't want to be a burden.
According to my sources, the Silver Falcons are going\nto get rid of what's left of the Conqueror's army, sir!\nGood riddance!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Whatever happened to that regular\nwho said he was leaving to join\nthe Conqueror's army?
I haven't heard anything from him, sir!
A gloomy-looking man frequents the pub in Elysion,\nsir, and he's scaring the customers!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Everyone has something in their past\nthey'd like to hide.\nSome more than others.

Hmph. You're friends of the marquis.\nWhy have you come?
I cannot believe Lord Hermeien is still alive...\nBut the evil he radiates proves he is no longer human.\nTo think that something like this brings us to war...\nHmph. In the meantime, I shall have my emissaries\ngather some information.
I see it has begun.\nMy emissaries have told me of your stance in our\ncurrent situation. They have also informed me of\nsomething troubling.\nThe Third Committee was thought to have disbanded\nafter the incident in Nagapur, but apparently some\nstragglers are trying to pick up where they left off.\nAs if I have the time to deal with this sort of trouble now!
With all the confusion lately, it's been increasingly\ndifficult to keep on top of things...\nI've recently received reports of Third Committee cells\nassembling in Nagapur, Elysion, and even this very\ncastle.\nAdding to that is a report from the Academy, saying some\ntop-secret Remnant-related research documents have\nbeen stolen, and possibly leaked to the black market.\nIf that information were to end up in the wrong hands\nlike those of the Third Committee\nwho knows what\ntrouble we'd be in for...
Remnants have powers that we mortals cannot even\nbegin to fathom.\nIf we cannot even control ourselves, how can we\npresume to control them?\nHumility... It is something that must not be forgotten.\n...Even if you lot are the only ones who remember it.
I never thought the day would come when\nwe would meet again.\nYou have walked your path;\nI have walked mine.\nAs for the Third Committee members, according\nto my emissaries, they have acquired a relic\nby the name of Leithion's Sword.\nI've not heard of such a sword.\nI know not what they're up to but\nI must do everything I can to find out.
Who are you?\nYou don't look familiar...\nDo you realize that you are standing in\nthe presence of Duke Ghor, a legendary\nhero and possessor of the Bilqis!?
The Duke of Ghor is the head of\nthe Congress!\nYou must show some respect!
Why are you still here?\nDon't you know that the Congress\nmeets in Elysion?
Lord...Hermeien... No, it can't be...
I will make the Conqueror regret\nhaving laid a hand on Duke Ghor!
What is it?
It appears the marquis has taken\nquite a liking to you.
What is it?
You are an interesting young man.\nYou manage to capture the hearts\nof those around you with ease.
What is it?
Those who gather here all possess\nthat same look you hold in your eyes.\nIt pleases me so.
What is it?
Marion knows how long it has been since men arrived at\nthis castle\nsince this town came into being.\nThe people that helped make this town what it is were not\nthe purest of souls, but they were dauntless and\ndetermined.\nTheir only goal was to make a better future.\nI can see that same look in your eyes.\n...\nHowever, I see something else in your eyes... A certain\nsparkle that I've seen in my own as well.\nWho are you, my child?
What is it, Rush?
You want to dig beneath Ghor Castle!?\nDon't be absurd.\nNot too long ago, some strange qsiti was asking about the\nsame thing\nbabbling on about ruins and miracles and\nother such tripe.\nEither way, this is no time to be playing treasure hunter.\nDreams and imagination can be a good thing, but there is\na certain time and place for them to be indulged. You\nand your little qsiti friend need to keep that in mind.
A mercenary going by the name of Gaou?\nYes, I've heard of him. He's the one they call the King.\nWhy?\n...\nI see. Interesting...\nDon't fret. I will handle it.

Welcome to Melphina, town of scholars.\nThis is Cobalt Plaza.\nBreathe in the clean air. Mmmm.\nThe floating sphere?\nThat's the Remnant Blue Elf!\nIt heightens people's spirits and wards off\nevil souls. It's the purest of Remnants.
Message 2
Message 3
Oh no, oh no!\nMelphina's Lord, Meister Olebeag, is suffering from some\nmysterious illness, but no one knows why!\nMistress Marsha of the Forest Maidens is praying and\ndoing all that she can, but it doesn't look good... Isn't\nthere anything anyone can do!?
Message 5
Message 6
The floating spheres are missing?\n...Oh, you must mean the Blue Elf.\nSix months ago, a Forest Maiden was kidnapped, and\nwas ransomed in exchange for the Blue Elf.\nMeister Olebeag and Sir Roberto apologized profusely\nfor giving in to the kidnappers' demands, but the girl\nwas safe, and that's all that matters.
Message 5 (Seizing Remnant)
Message 6 (Seizing Remnant)
We Forest Maidens pray to the Last Leaf,\nthe divine Remnant that protects\nCrookfen.\nA routine ritual of prayer strengthens\nthe seal of protection, but the seal\nseems to have weakened of late.\nThere are many organizations that want to\nget their hands on this Remnant, but we've\ngot nothing to worry about.\nThe Order of Melphina is on our side!

Greetings.\nIs it so rare to meet a yama interested\nin mystic learnings?
I'm just a rookie spellcrafter now, but\nI was once a notable guard.\nI used to get jobs from the folks at\nthe Academy and even the Congress.\nI did a lot of work as a security guard\nfor the Academy. No others could\nmatch the amount they were offering.
I'm just a rookie spellcrafter now, but\nI was once a notable guard.
One job I did for the Academy was to guard\nthe door of the lab where they were\nconducting experiments.\nLooking back, I should have realized what they\nwere doing was illegal and dangerous.\nOne day, the Remnant being used in the experiment\nbegan emitting a light and then there was\nan explosion.\nI drifted in and out of consciousness for\na few days.\nLuckily, I recovered soon after.\nBut my arms... To this day, I can\nbarely move them.\nWith my handicap, I couldn't continue my job.\nNo one found me necessary anymore.\nEveryone started drifting away from me.
The explosion killed most of the nerves\nin my arms.\nI couldn't continue my job.
I'd lost the only job I knew how to do.\nI had nothing. I didn't know what\nthe future held for me anymore.\nEvery day, I watched the sunset at Fornstrand,\nthinking of how easy it would be to jump\nin the ocean and disappear.\nThat's when a mitra calling herself\nthe festival maiden came along. She sat\ndown next to me and quietly listened to my story.\nThen she turned to me and smiled and said,\n"Why don't you try learning to use spells?"\nWhat was she thinking? I'd relied on my brawn\nto get me through everything in the past.\nSomeone like me couldn't use spells.\nBut before I could say anything, I glanced over\nand caught her smile. It gave me strength and hope.\nIt made me feel like I could do anything.\nOr maybe I just wanted to grab onto something\nto get me out of this feeling of despair.
I was feeling hopeless until a mitra\ncalling herself the festival maiden\nconvinced me to try a new art\nspells.
It wasn't easy, learning this new art.\nEveryone who knew me laughed at me.\nThey thought it was hopeless.\nBut I didn't give up\nI couldn't.\nThis was my last hope.\nAfter a lot of studying, I finally got\nthe hang of it. I'll never forget that\nfeeling of using my first spell.\nI've decided to become an expert\nspellcrafter. It might seem like an impossible\ndream, but I'm willing to try.\nI want to achieve this dream and seek out\nand thank the girl who gave me something\nto live for.\nI bet she's out there helping others at this\nvery moment.\nI look forward to seeing her again.
Hey, Rush.\nI'm going to keep journeying with you\nso I can experience and learn what I\nneed to become an expert spellcrafter.
Yes?\nWhat is it?
What is it?
Have you seen Lord David?\nHe should not be wandering around alone.\nIf you speak to him, let him know that\nI was looking for him.
Where has he gone?
...
This town seems its usual self.\nHowever, Lord David should never\nhave gone off alone.\nTell him I am looking for him.
Have you seen Lord David?
If it had been handed over to us,\nwe would have made great use of it.\nThough who knows what Lord David\nwould have said to that.
Disregard what I stated before.
The Remnant Ark...\nI've seen something similar to it,\nbut I can't recall what or where...
I can't recall...
Lord David made his choice.\nI will stay by his side till death.
Feast your eyes on that Remnant.\nIts beauty is mesmerizing.\nWhat it would be like to float inside of it...\nWhat fun it would be!
What beauty...
...
These rumors of Remnants going missing\nhad me worried, but it looks like\neverything is alright.
Indeed.
Just like Athlum...\nWill we ever see that exquisite splendor again?
I cannot believe this...
It exists somewhere in the world.
We must find it.
We will see this to the end.
Hey, Rush! Take a look at these weapons!\nThey're beauties!
Hrm.
Lady Emma...
Hey, Rush!\nThings are still okay.\nYou gotta lighten up!
You gotta lighten up!
Everyone's spirits are down now that\nthe Remnants are gone.\nEven our weapons lost their flare.
Even our weapons lost their flare.
I have no clue what's going on.\nAll I know is that I'll go wherever\nyou decide to go.
I'm ready to do this!
Let's go, Rush!\nI'll bust up anyone who gets in our way!
What am I doing?\nJust taking a walk.\nIt's impossible for me to wander the streets\nof Athlum or Celapaleis alone.\nDon't tell Torgal you found me.
Don't tell Torgal you found me.
The Remnants here are safe and sound.
...
Here, too...\nSo it is not just Athlum.
...
Do I look worried?\nI'm doing the best I can not to show it...
Are we going to make it?
It's time, Rush.\nLet's finish this together!
Nothing seems out of the norm here.\nBut there is a lot going on beneath\nthe surface. We should be careful.
We should be careful.
Disappearing Remnants...\nHow does this fit into the puzzle?\nThere's something I'm missing...
There's something I'm missing...
Don't just stand there, Rush.\nHelp us find a way to the Sacred Lands.
There has to be a way.
I will protect Lord David as she did.\nI will also provide protection for you and Miss Irina.

I had no idea that Neo had already claimed Leticia as\nhis maiden...\nI joined the Order with Neo and I got to know him well.\nHe's a brave man with decent fighting skills.\nBut...I'm much better-looking! And if you're talking\nmuscles...there's no comparison, I totally blow him\naway. I just can't understand it...\n...Just...just leave me alone.
You made such a valiant effort in the great battle on\nthe Malbourge Flatlands!\nI was there, too. You really impressed me with the way\nyou were handling your sword.\nNeo and Leticia?\nOh, I'm over that.\nWatching you on the battlefield, I realized that I don't\nneed a woman\njust being a strong warrior is\nrewarding enough.\nThanks for cheering me up!
I train every day to become a great knight.\nI have yet to find the maiden for me, though.\nI wonder if I'll ever find her...
I was just in Cobalt Plaza, praying to the Blue Elf\nfor Meister Olebeag's quick recovery.\nThat's when I found my soul mate!\nShe had very beautiful eyes, filled with sincerity.\nI haven't told her how I feel yet.\nI hope that someday we can devote our lives to\neach other and protect this town together.
With the loss of the Blue Elf, people are worried about\nthe town's future. I went to the guild today to see if I\ncould help out somehow...\nThat's when I found my soul mate!\nShe had very beautiful eyes and was absolutely radiant!\nOf course, I haven't actually spoken to her yet...\nBut I hope that someday we can devote our lives to\neach other and protect this town together.
Have you seen a white qsiti around these parts?\nHe was the leader and sole survivor of the brigade\nthat was eradicated in the Catacombs.\nLord knows where he is now.\nI pray he's not up to anything foolish.
Hmph.\nI have no time for you.
I hear you're the leader of this troupe.\nHas it come down to this?\nI, Leucetius, taking orders from a mitra child?\nI volunteered only upon hearing of help needed\nby Athlum's special forces.\nI have no time for childish games.\nI will show you who is a worthy leader, after I\n"negotiate" with the generals.
I have nothing to say to you.
Th-that yama...\nHis strength...\n...\nDon't look at me like that.\nI threw the match to allow him\nto save face.\nHe's no worthy opponent of mine.\nThe other generals should make for\nbetter opponents.
Leave me alone.
Th-that mitra...\nHer flawless sword technique...\n...\nDon't look at me like that.\nI threw the match.\nI would never hurt a lady.\nI need to go up against someone of higher\nrank than the generals to get myself heard.
Go away. Now.
I-I can't stop shaking...\nHis intimidation is overwhelming...\n...\n...Rush, you know the marquis well,\ndon't you?\nThen tell me this.\nWhen he...his lord...glared at me, I couldn't\nstop shaking.\nHow does a mitra who hasn't been around\nfor 20 years make others tremble in fear?\nIs it a trait of a marquis?\nOr perhaps something acquired by being\nthe owner of the extraordinary Gae Bolg?\n...Whatever the case, Rush, I owe you\nan apology. You are a worthy leader if\nyou can control such mighty warriors.\nIf you ever need a hand, don't\nhesitate to ask.
Have you come to me for help?\nDon't be shy.
The barkeep is my mentor.\nI strive to be like him someday!
Then quit yapping and start working!

You must be the young man helping out with the crises around\ntown. I am Olebeag, Lord of Melphina. Speaking for all of us\nhere, I would like to extend my thanks.
I am Olebeag, Lord of Melphina.\nWelcome.\nOur town may be small and remote, but for academic\nor mystic studies, there is no better place on the\ncontinent.
I've lost control of my body of late.\nIt's as if some great power is trying to take\nover me... It is truly an unpleasant feeling.
I have fallen ill and I need rest.\nI apologize, for you have come such\na long way to get here.
Young Sykes. It is good to see you again.\nYou have Roberto and my gratitude for the aid\nyou've provided the Order.\nPlease, stay in our town and rest your weary bodies.
Young Sykes. It is good to see you again.\nI cannot express fully enough my gratitude for\nthe risks you've taken for Melphina.\nYou are indeed the hero of this town.
The Blue Elf is our treasure.\nHowever, nothing is of more importance than\none's life.\nWe shall immediately hand over the Blue Elf\nto save the life of the Forest Maiden.
I am Olebeag, Lord of Melphina.\nOur town may be small and remote, but we welcome you\nall the same.
My health has failed me of late...\nI must say, it is quite bothersome.
I am Roberto, commander of the Order of Melphina.\nSeek me out if ever you are interested in joining us.
Meister Olebeag...\nWas that there were a way I might ease your suffering...
Meister Olebeag!\nI hate to see you in such a state! If only I could\nsacrifice myself and rid you of the pain you suffer!
Master Sykes, welcome to our humble town.\nHad it not been for your aid, this town may have fallen.\nWould you consider joining the Order?
Meister Olebeag, I beg for your forgiveness!\nTo think that we of the Order were unable to\nprevent this from happening...\nI have never felt so powerless...
Master Sykes... If it pleases you, I would give you this key\nto Siebenbur. We will have no more use for it...
Welcome, traveler.\nI am Marsha, the leader of the Forest Maidens.
Meister Olebeag is in a terrible state... I'm very worried.
There's a strange power that surrounds Meister Olebeag.\nIt feels heavy and strange and...wrong.\nWho could be behind this?
Sir Rush, I'm so glad you could come.\nThanks to you, we were able to replace the seal.\nAs the leader of the Forest Maidens, I extend\nour gratitude.
If it weren't for you, Roberto and I might have met\nour end.\nYou're Melphina's hero.\nThe girls of the Forest Maidens are giggling about how\nthey all want you to be the one they pledge their lives\nto.
I see you have a parfumlily. Its scent\nhas a calming effect. It's useful for\nwhen you're feeling troubled.
Are you worried about something?\nHave you heard of the parfumlily flower?\nIts smell is very relaxing.
The fiends after the Blue Elf were able to escape.\nWe chased them to the Numor Mines, but once there,\nthey skittered into the shadows like the rats they are.\nOoh, to think they roam free...

The day I pass leadership of the Order of Melphina on to a\nyounger knight is not far off.
Master Sykes, if I may have your ear for a moment...\nHave you ever questioned your existence\nyour\nlife's purpose?\nFrom the moment I made my pledge with Marsha, I have\ngiven my all to the Order. Everything I have done,\nevery action I have taken, has been to protect Melphina.\nWithout my knighthood, I fear I may become lost, knowing\nnot what to do with my life.\nThese thoughts haunt me endlessly of late...
Without my knighthood, I fear I may become lost...\nThese thoughts haunt me endlessly of late.
All my life, I have done my utmost to be a worthy leader\nof the Order of Melphina, and use that position to protect\nour lands from any threat.\nHowever, meeting you has given me a second purpose.\nEndless wars rage on in our world. From now on, I must\nthink of helping not only Melphina, but the entire\nworld.\nEven if frailty of body leads me to give up knighthood, I\nwill never discard the values I have lived by. I will\ncontinue to serve the world in whatever capacity I can.\nTo that end, I would be honored if you allow me to\ncontinue to accompany your troupe.
Greetings.\nEven as I give up knighthood, I will continue\nto serve the world as I have been.

Nagapur's fame stems from the awesome dragon\nthat protects it.
I'm certain you saw the immense dragon that rises\nabove the city. That is the Gwayn, which has\nprotected Nagapur from time immemorial.
That impressive building in front of the Gwayn\nis Wyrmskeep. Our Lord, Duke Wilfred Hermeien\nresides there.
This is Flussbahn, the gateway to the town.
I've waited here for his return for a long, long\ntime...\nBut the heart is a fickle and ever-changing\nthing...much like this river here, I suppose.
This is Southwing.\nIt's called that because we're south of the Gwayn.
All these are headed to Flussbahn, and then we'll\nsend them down the canal to where they need to\ngo.
If you wish to purchase weapons or accessories,\nyou should look in the shops of Northwing.\n...Though from the looks of you, you'll be lucky\nto do more than merely window shop.
This is Northwing, a shopper's paradise.
Wow, what a view!\nYou can see all the way up to the mouth of\nFlussbahn today.\nIt's days like this that make you glad to be alive!
You can see the Gwayn from all over town.\nIt's always watching, so you can't do anything\nbad.\nBrrr...
Sorry, we're closed at present.\nWe'll be back open as soon as we can, so please\ntry again later.

This is a nice, quiet meeting place.\nThe streets of Nordenalm are so busy!\nBecause of all the shops, merchants and\nsoldiers are clomping around all day!\nThey're so loud!
Where is he?\nHe was supposed to be here ages ago.\nBut he's not one to break promises, so\nI trust he'll show up.\nMaybe we should have picked a better\nspot to meet.

These canals are used to ship this cargo\nhere to different locations.\nThe trade business has improved since\nWilfred Hermeien became lord.\nMy days are busy, busy, busy!\nThe previous lord couldn't have pulled\nthe town THIS far.\nHe did seem like a kind man, though.\nOn a seperate note, I've been hearing\nrumors of an army advancing from\nthe west... Scary times, these are.
I heard from a merchant friend of mine that\nthe Conqueror is just inches away from here!\nWhat is war good for, anyway?

You are Rush Sykes, I presume.\nI am Oswald.\nMarina was right\nyou have her eyes, filled with\ngoodness and justice.\nYou need not worry about her. She is about, gathering\ninformation to help you on your journey.\nShe was here until just a moment ago.\n...\nI realize it is hard to trust my words, but I know all about\nyou, Marina, and your sister Irina.\nWhen the time is right, I will tell you all there is to know.
Your mother was right.\nYou have the same eyes, filled with goodness and justice.
Hello, Rush Sykes.\nI have something to share with you.\nDid you know that there is more than one way to enter\nWyrmskeep? In addition to the boat, it can be infiltrated\nfrom the waterway beneath\nSudenalm\nthe\nAqueducts\nForget not this information, for it may come in handy\nsomeday.
Hello, son.\nI have something to share with you.\nDid you know that there is more than one way to enter\nWyrmskeep? In addition to the boat, it can be infiltrated\nfrom the waterway beneath\nSudenalm\nthe\nAqueducts\nOhoho, I see you are suspicious... There is no need for\nthat. Instead, remember what I've told you. It may come\nin handy someday.
Marina was a bright young girl.\nShe learned the Remnant theory in\nmere seconds.\nGranted... To this day, I have doubts\nas to whether that was a positive\nthing...\nRush Sykes, you must save your sister.\nMarina deserves to be with her family\nagain\nwith you and your sister\nand your father.
You have your mother's eyes\nfilled with good and justice.
Welcome back.\nHave you finished walking around town?\nYup, saw everything.\nNope, not yet.
Alright, come with me then.
Alright.\nKeep at it. Come to me when you've\nfinished.
Are you ready to enter the\nAqueducts\nReady steady!\nI need a sec.
Alright. Let's go!
This is Lord Hermeien's territory.\nWe must prepare ourselves for a long battle.\nWe'll leave as soon as we are ready.
Rush! Miss Irina is being held in the audience chamber\nof Wyrmskeep!\nThese stairs will take us down to the\nAqueducts\n, and\nwe can take them all the way through to the castle.\nLord David is waiting. Please hurry.
Taking the Aqueducts will allow us to enter\nWyrmskeep with minimal fighting.
An old man familiar with this town gave me directions\nto the Aqueducts.\nHe reminds me of someone... But I can't quite put my\nfinger on who.
Miss Irina is right up here!\nCome on, let's go bust some heads!

This is the biggest shopping district in Nagapur\nNordenalm\nWeapons and accessories, components and items...\nProducts from around the world are sailed here through\nthe canals!\nThere is a pub and guild here as well, if that suits your\nfancy.
I hear whispers of an upcoming war.\nMake sure you pop into the shops around\nhere and buy what you need to ready yourself.

After the Gwayn turned the town into a fiery mess, the\nsurvivors all fled to Nordenalm, since most of it was left\nintact.\nAll we could do was stand and watch while our town\nwent up in flames...
Look at how gallant the Gwayn stands.\nWith that guarding our town, only a fool would think\nof invading us.\n...Though, my kid tends to burst into tears when he\nsees it. I have to admit, it can be slightly intimidating.\nThat's when I tell him that our town stays safe\nbecause of that Remnant. The Gwayn protects us\nfrom the evil out there!
My kid asked me if there was going to be a war. He must\nhave heard about the Conqueror and his army.\nI told him that the Gwayn will protect us, so there's\nnothing to worry about. I've never seen a bigger smile\non his face.
Message 3
Everyone's saying that the Gwayn went on a mindless\nrampage, but I disagree.\nThe town would have been destroyed by the Conqueror\nif the Gwayn hadn't done what it did.\nI want to believe... No, I do believe that the Gwayn was\ntrying to protect us from them.
There's quite a large sewer beneath the town. It\nconnects the canals.\nThere have been monster sightings there of late, so\nno civilians are allowed to enter that area.
The entrance to the Aqueducts?\n...Oh, you mean the sewer.\nIt's in Sudenalm.\nYou're not thinking of going there, are you?\nIt's dark, damp, and worst of all, the smell is\nhorrendous! Not to mention that it's filled with\nmonsters!\nNothing is worth going down there.
Message 3
As long as I live in this town, I'll never be able to forget\nwhat happened.\nThis town is absolutely desolate now. So many people\nhave left in fear of the same thing happening again.\nI'm not one of them, though. I was born here. This is\nmy home. No one could ever get me to leave, no\nmatter what happens.
Never would I have dreamt that Nagapur\nwould end up in such a state.\nIf only there was something I could do\nto help this town and its people.
Well? Are you finished?\nSure am!\nNo, not just yet.
Alright, meet me in Flussbahn.
I said to come to me when you've finished.\nNot a moment sooner.
Hello, Rush.\nI can't thank you enough for allowing me to join you.
I've traveled far and wide, searching\nfor something powerful. On my journey,\nI caught word of an old legend.\nSomewhere in the world exists a weapon\nof extraordinary power.\nWith it, one can defeat even the strongest\nof foes.
It is said that somewhere in the world\nexists a weapon of extraordinary power.\nI wonder if this is true.
Standing here, watching passers-by,\nreminds me of my hometown.\nThe same sun shines through the blue\nskies, causing shadows behind the buildings.\nMy town was not rich, but there was\nan abundance of happiness and joy.\nI wish I could go see it with my own\neyes once more...
I wish I could see it with my own\neyes once more...
When my town burned to the ground,\nall I could do was stand there and\nstare at what had become of it.\nThat image... It is not something I\nwill ever forget as long as I live and breathe.\nI've traveled across many lands in search\nof the man who caused such devastation.\nHe will continue to roam the world\nuntil I get my revenge. That is when\nmy journey will end.
My journey will end when I get revenge\non the one responsible for causing\nsuch devastation to my town.
Greetings.\nI have been yearning for revenge,\nbut no more.\nMy memories with him, my desert\ntown that no longer exists\nboth\nhave become a special part of me.\nWhatever happens, I will always have\nthem to keep me strong.\nIf it's no burden, I would like to\njoin you on your journey.\nPerhaps it will allow me to find\na new goal in life.
Hello, Rush.\nEveryone is kind and generous.\nI am enjoying myself, something I\nwas not able to do for a long time.
Good morning!\nIs everything alright?
I need to rest. I feel a bit dizzy...\nWhat? Me? Lost? Of course not!\nDon't be silly!
I need to rest. I feel a bit dizzy...
Maybe I worked myself too hard at Kosmosfest...\nO-oh! H-hi, Rush! You don't need to worry about me.\nI'll be better in no time!
Maybe I worked myself too hard at the festival...
Lately, it seems like my powers aren't as strong as\nthey used to be. This has never happened to me before...\nI really don't get it.\nDuring Kosmosfest, I felt my powers heighten like\nnever before. I could sense so many Remnants...\nBut once the festival ended, that super power went\nwith it. Maybe...maybe I used too much, so my body\nneeds time to recharge?\nI'm really getting worried. What if this isn't temporary?\nWhat should I do? A Cosmos Maiden needs her\npowers, you know?\nMaybe I should go talk to Mistress Marsha... She might\nknow what to do.
Lately, my powers have gotten really weak...\nI don't know what to do!\nMaybe I should go talk to Mistress Marsha.
Oh... This is a parfumlily, right?\nIt's beautiful. That's so sweet of you...\nHm? That's funny...\nI feel...stronger, somehow.\nLike my powers have come back...\nNow that I think of it, my mother always told me\nthat a Maiden's powers were like waves...\nEndlessly flowing from the sea to the land, and\nback out to sea, the power becomes one with\nthe earth...\nAhh...I think I finally get it!\nMy power\nmy hopes and dreams become strength\nfor others... But their supportive thoughts return and\nreplenish my power.\nThank you so much, Rush! I feel so much better\nnow, and it's all due to you.
I'm all better now!\nI want to keep traveling the world.\nJust come looking for me if I get lost, okay?
There've been a lot of cases of kids going missing\nfrom town lately. My niece being one of them...\nI've been doing some searching of my own, but no luck.\nDammit!\nI can't open up shop with this hanging over my head.
Hey, I heard you solved the kidnapping cases in town.\nWhen my niece came back home, I hugged her so tight.\nI never wanted to let her go.\nWith that debacle over with, I was able to open shop\nagain. Take a look around!

Welcome to the guild.\nHow may I help?
I've come all the way from Ghor Castle\nwith my friends. What a trek it was\nover the\nHeroic Ramparts\nHave you seen it yet with your own eyes?\nIt's said that one of the lords of Nagapur\nbuilt that never-ending castle wall.\nIt's like it's representing\nthe never-ending flow of time.
I've traveled here with my friends\nfrom Ghor through the Heroic Ramparts.\nIt's hard to believe the state of this town...
The\nPlain of Luhang\nthat lies in front\nof Nagapur is the battleground that has\nprotected us from invaders for ages.\nThis is where the legendary warrior of\nNagapur, Luhang of Zahaad, fought and beat\nthe entire imperial army.\nAlthough this battle may be just a fictional\ntale, the soldiers of Nagapur still talk about\nhim in awe.
Have you seen the Plain of Luhang lately? There isn't\na single blade of grass left, thanks to the Gwayn...\nI still can hardly believe that our protector did that...

Welcome to Pub Drachenhauch!
Welcome.\nAre you headed to Wyrmskeep?\nYou need to take the boat that leaves\nthe canal from Flussbahn.\nI don't mean to be rude, but are you\nan acquaintance of Lord Hermeien?\nIf not, you won't make it to the castle.\nCommoners don't have a place on that boat.
Welcome.\nThe Aqueducts, you say?\nThere's an entrance in Sudenalm, but...\nThere've been monsters sightings in\nthat area lately, so they generally\nkeep that entrance locked.
Sir Zolean always frequents this establishment alone.\nUp until three years ago, he used to come with a friend.\nI wonder what became of him.
Nagapur's previous lord was Lord Oswald Hermeien.\nHe was a very generous and good man, but he suddenly\ndisappeared several years ago. Lord Wilfred claimed the\nthrone not long after.\nIt is only a rumor, but some say that he was set up\nand thrown out of Wyrmskeep by Lord Wilfred.\nI certainly hope that isn't the truth. There is nothing\nuglier than a rivalry between parent and child.
In Sudenalm, you may encounter an old man with kind\neyes.\nRumor has it he knows a lot about Wyrmskeep\neven\nways to get inside. I don't know if there's any truth to\nthat, though.\nHe really reminds me of somebody...\nI just can't quite put my finger on who...
Barkeep, you've seen him, too, right?\nI'm talking about the old man in Sudenalm.\nHe saved me when I almost fell into\nthe canals the other day.\nThat's when I realized, he reminds me\nof someone... I just can't put my finger\non who it is...
Barkeep, you going to stay here and run the pub?\nI'm going to leave town with my family.\nBut before I go, I wanted to tell you something.\nThat old man who looked familiar to me...\nI finally figured out who he is.\nHe's the previous lord, Oswald Hermeien!\nBut I guess it doesn't matter now.
You've seen the Gwayn, yes?\nI've seen many, many Remnants\nin my time, but nothing is more\noverwhelming than that one.\nThere's quite a powerful-looking one\nin Balterossa, to the south, but\nit can't possibly overshadow the Gwayn.\nLad, you should go to different\nlands and see their Remnants with\nyour own eyes.
I never thought the Gwayn would\nbe capable of anything like this.\nI thought it was the strongest\nof them all.\nWell, I suppose it proved its powers.\nI just didn't think it would happen\nlike this...
I hear the Conqueror wants all the Remnants he can\nget his hands on.\nThe major cities can protect themselves with their\narmies, but what are the small towns to do?
I see a lot of black-hooded fellas\naround the pub lately.\nThey're all so rude and obnoxious!\nI mean, who brings a white jelly monster\nto a pub!?\nThe other customers got scared and\nthey all up and left! And here I am,\ncleaning up after it...
Many lost their lives in the Gwayn\ndebacle, and the pub has lost a lot\nof customers, too.\nAnd the ones who do come here\nall look so solemn.\nThough there is a silver lining to\nwhat happened.\nEver since Lord Hermeien passed,\nthe black-hooded gang hasn't been\naround.\nNow this place will be a perfect spot\nfor those to mourn in peace.
The Duke of Ghor was a loyal aide to\nour previous lord.\nThat's why when Nagapur is in trouble\nhis lordship comes to our rescue.
What in the God Emperor's up with this!?\nEver since the Duke of Ghor became\nchairman of the Congress, the people\nof Ghor Castle have been acting so pompous!\nI doubt the duke will be in charge\nfor long, though.\nThat yama can't fill the shoes of\nour Lord Hermeien!
Even if the Conqueror tries to invade Nagapur, the\nDuke of Ghor will handle it.\nNothing's gonna happen to this town.
Hello, Rush Sykes.\nI hear you are looking for a way to the Sacred Lands.\nI have some information that may be of help.\nTravel northeast of Nagapur to the\nSixth Path of\nSiebenbur\n. What you desire may be found at the end\nof the road.\n...\nRush, Irina.\nI think of you as my own grandchildren.\nPlease, return safely.
Travel to the\nSixth Path of Siebenbur\nWhat you desire will be at the end of the road.
It's you...\nNever thought the day would come when I'd be working\nfor you.
You again? You know, you don't gotta spy on me all\nthe time. I know you haven't got anything to complain\nabout, 'cause I'm working hard.\nAnd I'll continue to work hard...as long as you keep\npaying me.
What, you think that if you don't keep an eye on me\nI'll jump you or something? ...Pssh, whatever, man.\nSeriously, that only happened once. Okay, maybe twice...
You again... You seriously need something better to do\nwith your time.\nAight then, lemme ask you something: what're you\nfighting for? You owe that marquis something?\nNah... I can see from your face that that ain't the real\nreason... Whatever. No skin off my back either way.
You again...\nHow about you leave me alone?
Yo...Rush, or whatever.\nWhadda you think about the state of the world lately?\nI'm not talking 'bout peace or war or anything, just...\nSomething ain't quite right, yanno?\nI've been binding Remnants all my life, and it hasn't ever\nfelt like it's been feeling lately. It's just... I don't even\nknow how to describe it.\nI bet that Marquis of yours is feeling it, too. You can't\nbe telling me you haven't noticed anything.
Something's wrong.\nMaybe...Remnants aren't like I always thought they were.
The cries of Remnants...\nThe essence of Remnants...\nDammit! I can't deal with this anymore!\nAight, Rush, time for you to come clean on this Remnant\nstuff. Howcome you can control 'em so easy when the\nrest of us are bustin' our asses? What'd you do!?\n...\nSorry. Didn't mean to get heated. I know you're a good\nkid\nlook at all the friends you've got.\nI just want an answer. Maybe...maybe we weren't meant\nto have control over Remnants after all...
Hey, Rush, holla.\nSo, I decided to stop overthinking all this Remnant stuff.\nAll that wallowing and angsting shit, it's not my style.\nSo, gimme some work! I'm bored as hell!
Everything is so serene...and boring.
Days of nothingness prove that\nthere is peace in your life.
Whatever...

There's a man in Celapaleis who's sweet\none second, but angry the next. A few women\nare fawning over him, saying he's their ideal man!
Isn't that exciting?
Love originates from surprise.
I want surprise. I want excitement!
There's a qsiti who stands in the middle\nof busy streets and glares at anyone\nwho bumps into him. What a freak!
Isn't that exciting?
It is difficult to touch what is fragile,\nas are people's hearts.
Do you really think this qsiti has\na fragile bone in his body?
There's a mysterious woman who looks like she\nhas the weight of the world on her shoulders.\nI wonder if she needs help with something.
Isn't that exciting?
At a certain point, one must stop and\nlook back at the path they have walked.\nThat is destiny.
Meaning, you'll know what you were\ndestined to do once you reach that\npoint?
A bunch of Bloody Alice soldiers were\nat the moor. Apparently, they're getting ready\nfor something big.
Isn't that exciting?
Determination is the key to success.
I can't argue with you there.
The Jhana are now causing trouble in\nthe Great Sand Sea! Apparently, not even\nthe Gae Bolg can teach them a lesson.
Isn't that exciting?
Obliviousness is the shortcut to destruction.
They'll be extinct in no time.
The Silver Falcons are going to rid\nthe area of the Jhana!\nThey're so dependable!
Isn't that exciting?
Those who are ignorant of the justice\nof others do not know the true\nmeaning of the word.
Do you really think the Silver Falcons\nare acting out of selfishness?\nI don't know about that...
The Silver Falcons are going to get\nrid of what's left of the Conqueror's army.\nGood riddance!
Isn't that exciting?
Glory is given to a victor until his\nnext loss.
That's why the Silver Falcons keep\nslaying the bad guys. They never lose.
A really creepy man's been going to the pub\nin Elysion a lot lately. I wonder what his story is.
Isn't that exciting?
Only a fool thinks he is surrounded\nby fools.
So you're saying this man is up to\nsomething, huh?

Rush, we are about to walk into a den of monsters, so\nlook sharp. We will be fine as long as we handle each\none individually.
Okay, got it.
Take this. It is an\nAlizarin Orb\nIt will enable you to use mystic arts.
Mystic arts?
Perhaps the term "spell" is more common... It's a way\nto channel energy through your weapon, with fantastic\nresults.
Huh...
With this\nAlizarin Orb\n, you can channel spells through\nyour weapons as well. Now you can attack enemies\nwith mystic arts.
Cool! Thanks a lot!

Hey there, buddy! This's the heart of the mining\ncity of Royotia, Byon Sector. There ain't much\nto do, but feel free to make yourself at home.\nThat range of mountains over there is the Altonas.\nMt. Altona's actually a volcano, and if it ever\nblew its top, we'd all be barbeque.\nBut it's okay, 'cause we got that big rock there\nthat's the Emeth Tag. It keeps the volcano in check.
[[2nd level message]]
[[3rd level message]]
Hey, buddy! Welcome to Byon. There ain't much\nto do, but if you're looking for a miner, you're\nin the right place.\nLately, the big man, Lord Priam, seems to've\ncome down with something... The usual\nmedicines and potions ain't working, neither.\nAll of us miners've been doing our best to\nfigure out how to get him better.

Hey kid, what're you doin' in Byon?\nWhat, you been underground too long?

That bastard Conqueror stole our Emeth Tag,\nbut the rumor 'round the pub is that there's\nsomethin' worse behind Altona heatin' up...\nSupposedly, like hundreds of years ago some\nevil bird was sealed under Royotia, an' it\nwakin' up is wakin' the volcano, too.\nSounds blazin' ridiculous, don't it? But either\nway, if the volcano blows, we're all goners.\nWonder if Ghor needs any miners...
[[4th level message]](after the Remnant is stolen)
Long ago, terrible earthquakes shook the land\nhere every day.\nIt was unlivable.\nOne man bound himself to the Emeth Tag, and\nfrom then on, the volcano was calm.\nThat man became the first ruler of Royotia.\nLord Priam, and of course, his son Paris,\nare the First's direct descendants.\nLord Priam is a very disciplined and dependable\nman. Conversely, Paris is sensitive and kind...\nmuch like his mother, may she rest in peace.

Lord Priam's poor health is completely\nunprecedented.

Is not your\nruler suffering as well?
[[4th level message]]
Half a year ago, a piercing shriek came from Mt.\nAltona. It was like the call of a giant bird...\nDirectly after the volcano started to rumble.\nThen a man appeared... Dressed all in red, he\ncame to the city and took away the Emeth Tag.\nCertainly, every able man fought to try and stop\nthe man. But no matter how we tried, not a\nsingle one of us could touch him.\nIt's so humiliating... We couldn't even protect\nour own city...

Believe it or not, I haven't been spending my\nyears longing to chit-chat with some mitra child.
Are you truly as imbecilic as you look?\nI have nothing to say to you.\nUgh, I have absolutely no idea how Torgal can\nstand to live around such idiots.
I have no idea how Torgal stands to live around\nsuch idiots without killing himself...or you.
You again?\nThat reminds me... The smallest of your Four\nGenerals was saying... "My, Allan, even though\nyou're sovani too, you act so differently!"\nWhat the hell is that supposed to mean!? Trying to\ninsult me, is that it? That qsiti's getting too big\nfor its nonexistent britches, don't you think?\nNext time you see that little thing, you'd better\ntell him to watch his abnormally long tongue if\nhe wishes to keep it!\n...\nNo. It's not worth getting this worked up over\na tiny thing like this. Just...forget about this, boy.
Rrgh... I can't let myself be baited by the words\nof some pathetic qsiti...
You again.\nThat reminds me... I saw Torgal get angry at one\nof your Four Generals...that hulking lump of a\nfish-man.\nAnd all over something as insignificant as sneaking\nfood. Ah, the lofty concerns of the famed Four\nGenerals...simpletons.\nYou know, I'd never seen him make such an overt\nreaction before, never. In fact, the prideful bastard\nwould brag that only fools would show any emotion...\nGood god, what in the seven hells happened to\nyou, Torgal!? How could you change so, you\nhypocritical\n...\nTsk...not again... Ugh, what is making me so angry?\nEven he is not worth that. It must be a side-effect\nof having to debase myself to talk to you!
Rrgh... I can't believe I let myself get this worked\nup over Torgal, no matter how galling he acts...
Hmph, you again.\nIt seems that Torgal has found someone else he's\nwilling to confide in. Someone other than me... Well.\nFine. It's fine. I'm glad to be rid of his piddling concerns.\n...What. What is that look for? Are you laughing at\nme? Let's see if you're still laughing when I rip you\nlimb from limb!\n...\n...That is,\nI believe now I understand why Torgal keeps you\naround. You people do keep things lively, don't you?\nI never felt this way when I lived apart from\nyou other races.\nI always considered those who let themselves be\nrankled by little things to be ridiculously foolish.\nAnd yet, after having spent this time traveling\nwith you people, I've found myself increasingly\nburdened by these...feelings.\nOdd... As time passes, the less I've thought that\nto be a bad thing... You people are truly the strangest\ngroup I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.\nI had planned to leave such a cloyingly buddy-buddy\ngroup at once, but for some reason you amuse me...\nPerhaps I'll stick around a bit longer.\n...What's that look for? You don't like it!? Don't\nthink I was joking about that limb-from-limb bit.
What do you want?\nI've decided I'll go with you people for a little longer.
Ah\nRush! You startled me. To be honest, I'm trying to\nlay low for a bit. Could you leave me be for now?
Ehh!?\nA-ahh, Rush...\n...\nWell, so long as we're to be fighting together,\nthere's no need to keep hiding this from you,\nI suppose...\nI don't know if you know it or not, but I was\nonce a general in the Celapaleian army.\nI'm not the strongest of people, but my pride and\ndevotion to my position is still unmatched by anyone.\nHowever...\nEverything changed after...\nHum hum?\nThat yama over there\ndid he just move? He did,\ndidn't he? ...I'm sorry, this is all I can say for now.\nConstant vigilance, after all...\nFor now, please let me alone.
Forgive me, Rush.\nFor now, please leave me alone.
Hmm...\nSeems like that yama isn't here today.\nAlright, then...\nLet me continue from last time.\nWhy is it that I, a former general of the Celapaleian\narmy, am now scuttling about, on the run...?\nIt's due to the secrets I know...secrets about my\nlord, Duke Qubine.\nLet me tell you, life as a fugitive is not the fun that\nit seems. But of late, I've been impressed by how\nlong I've been able to run, if I may say so myself.\nI mean, the search for me is a direct order from\nDuke Qubine. It is something to catch the attention\nof the majority of Celapaleis's army.\nHo ho ho!\nDidn't expect that, now did you!\nHwha\nRush\ndid you see that?\nJust now, over there, on that wagon! That qsiti\nlooks mighty suspicious!\nNo...I had best not say anything further.\nGo, get away...you don't know me.
Not now\nwho knows who is watching us?
Oh, Rush. Is it time to leave yet?\nLately, it seems my pursuers have increased in\nnumber and tenacity... I'd like to avoid staying in\npublic places for too long if at all possible.\nHrm.\nIt seems as if my flight is about to come to an end...\nNo, no need to worry. I've no intention of giving up\nnow. I'll continue to run so long as my feet will move.\nHowever... If something were to happen to me, I\nwant you to flee, and don't turn back. I have no\nintention of causing trouble for you or Pagus.\nYou know, since meeting up with you all, even\nthese days as a fugitive have been truly enjoyable.\n...I probably should speak to Sibal as well.\nAlright. Go on, go on.
This time traveling with you all has truly\nbeen enjoyable.\nI should go speak with Sibal as well...
Oh, Rush!\nIs it true that Duke Qubine's been struck down\nby some unknown illness?\nHrn... That Conqueror...it must be his doing. In the\nend, we weren't able to catch him after all...\nHm? What's that look for?\nOh, yes...forgive me.\nI suppose I have some explaining to do...\nIn truth, I was given a special mission by Duke\nQubine\nto gather information on the Conqueror.\nSadly, I was unable to find much of use...\nBut, I am quite an actor, hm? I had you and Sibal\nall thinking I was some delusional old man, didn't I!\nHo ho ho ho ho!\nCome now, don't be angry. It was a cover story...\nNothing personal, I assure you.\n...\nRush. It's terrible to think of, but the Conqueror\nstill lives. If left to do as he pleases, the world will\nonce again be thrown into confusion.\nI want to stop that from happening at any cost.\n...Consider it the final request of an old man who's\nspent the better part of his life fighting.\nAnd, that's how things are. I hope to continue to\nhave your help into the future. I'm counting on you!
Oh! Hello there, Rush. Lately my pursuers have\ndecreased by quite a bit... I can't decide if that's\na good thing or not, however.
Hm?\nA plot to tunnel beneath Ghor Castle?\nHo ho ho ho ho!\nReally now, do you think the Duke of Ghor\nwould allow such a thing?\nGoodness, Sibal has gone on about that for years,\nno point in trying to change his mind now. Can't\nteach old Jhana new tricks, you know?
Huh?\nWhat're you doing here, old lady?
Wha\nexcuse me?\nDo I even know you?
Oh, oops.\nUm, I thought you were someone else...
Hmph! Make sure you have the right\nperson next time!
S-sorry...
Hmph... I'll let it slide this time. Of course, that's on\nthe condition that there's never a second.
Calling someone "old lady" is rude and inconsiderate...\nespecially when they aren't old!
Hm? You again.
Uh.
You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!\nSay, ol\nO beautiful young maid, what're you doing\naround here?
Training.\nIn my family, it's a rite of passage\nto travel the world.
Huh... Sounds pretty tough.\nTake care of yourself, okay?
Thank you.
You're not as inconsiderate as I thought.
You're looking well.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
Could you please not call me that?\nIt sounds ridiculous, to say the least.
Well, it's not like I know your name.
Oh?
...
The name's Emmy.
Nice to meet you for real, finally.\nI'm
Rush. Rush Sykes.\nRight?
Wha\n? How did you know!?
I have my ways.
Take care, Rush.
What's the purpose of my training?\nWell...a lot of things. But in general,\ntraining the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.

What? Do you need something?
What do you want?
Have you seen Lord David?\nI do not feel comfortable letting him alone.\nIf you see him, please tell him I am looking for him.
What a troublemaker...
...
On the surface, it does not seem like this place\nhas changed very much...\nThat said, it is no place to let Lord David run about\nunsupervised.\nIf you see him, tell him I am looking for him.
You haven't seen Lord David?
If it was only going to be stolen anyway, we should\nhave taken the Remnant ourselves...\n...No, Lord David would never have stood for it.
Please forget I said anything.
The Remnant Ark...\nSurely there must be a similar Remnant elsewhere\nin the world...
I can think of nothing...
Lord David is as prepared as he can be.\nAll I have to do is to follow.
Ahh... What a spectacular Remnant.\nIt just has a certain presence, doesn't it?\nI feel as if I'd never tire of looking at it...\nHowever...\nIt doesn't look all that different from any\nother rock, does it...
Incredible...
...
After learning of Remnants disappearing the world over,\nI'd become more a bit wary, but look. This place is the\nsame as always...it's a small but appreciated blessing.
Yes, yes.
Then, it's just like Athlum...\nThe whole mood of the town is different.
What in the world is going on?
It must exist, somewhere...
Let's continue to search.
Let's finish this...learn the true ending of this tale.
Come and check out the weapons they have!\nAhh, from blunt to sharp, fancy decorative stuff\nto everyday weapons, I love 'em all!
Heheheheh...
Lady Emma...
Heya, Rush! Check it out\nthe Remnant's still alive\nand kicking!\nSo we can't get all down either, right?
We can't lose hope now!
Even the weapons seem kinda pooped out...\nGuess it's 'coz the Remnant's gone...
Geez, even the weapons seem pooped out...
Gah, if I have to think about this Remnant stuff\nany more, my head's gonna explode! You just tell\nme where to go when you've figured it out, okay?
I'm ready to rock whenever!
Let's go, Rush!\nDon't worry\nI'll knock down anybody in our way!
What am I doing?\nJust as it looks, taking a walk. As the Marquis,\nI can't just roam the streets alone in Athlum\nor Celapaleis...\nI'm certain Torgal is having conniptions, but let's\nkeep this between us, shall we?
Remember, you never saw me.
It seems the Emeth Tag is still untouched...
...
Royotia as well...\nThen, Athlum is not the only victim...
...
What am I rushing around for?\nTo be honest, I was mainly trying not to be recognized...
I hope we're not too late...
Let's go, Rush!\nAnd we'll return together\nvictorious!
The town may look the same as always, but\nthat's only at first glance.\nThere's plenty of rumbling beneath the surface...\nThis is no time to start slacking.
This place is rotten...
They've lost their Remnant as well...\nI suppose it could be just coincidence...\nCertainly seems like a plot, though...
I can't believe someone isn't behind all this...
Hey now, quit playing around and help us search,\nwill you? There's got to be another way to get to\nthe Sacred Lands, but we won't find it if you don't look.
Don't worry\nwe'll find it.
I'll look after Lord David since she cannot...\nSo you'd better do the same for Irina.

Hey, kid. Have you been to the southern cave,\nSiebenbur, yet? There're ruins a thousand years\nold down there.\nWe mercs are regularly hired as bodyguards by\nexcavation groups and scholars wanting to see\nthe ruins.\nIt's not bad money, if you've got the patience\nto deal with the jabbering of scholarly types.\nThing is... It's rumored there's some giant\nmonsters running around and breaking up the\nveins of ore.\nEh, I've never come across one, but I'm sure I\ncould easily take down one or two single-\nhanded!
Finding a lode of Damascus ore is the dream of every\nminer in Royotia... The ore's so valuable, finding some'd\nbe a one-way ticket to riches.\nHowever, the ore is real rare, and there aren't many\nfolk who've found a vein. It's rumored there's some in\nLavafender, but... That's a hell of a place to dig...literally!

Welcome to the Firestone!
So I was digging when I ended up all the way in\nLavafender. Guess I got carried away... Anyway,\nthat's when I see it...\nI swear to Marion this wasn't a mirage\nbut I'm\nin this sweltering-hot cave full of lava and I see\nthis young girl just standing there, all alone.\nSo, of course, I go to her\nI mean, it's\ndangerous, no place for some little slip of a\ngirl\nand get this: she disappears.\nInsane, right? I figure she's gotta be a ghost\nwith unfinished business. That's the only\nexplanation.\nHey, I toldja it wasn't a mirage! I know what I\nsaw!
Apparently Lord Priam's in bad shape.\nIt's real hard to believe, though\nhe's always\nbeen healthier than even us miners. He ain't\nthe type to get sick, 'specially not bad as this.\nIt's damned frustrating... Alls we can do is try\nand dig up some expensive ore, and try and hire\na healer from abroad.
Right before that Conqueror bastard marched\ninto town, this freaky voice like a bird call or\nsomething was heard all over town.\nFor some reason, hearing it made me think of\nthat ghost I saw down in Lavafender that one\ntime...\nMaybe the whole reason the Conqueror could\ntake the Emeth Tag in the first place was\nbecause of the ghost's curse!\n...Nah, that's crazy talk. I'm just freaking\nmyself out...
Long time ago, deep within the earth's molten\ncore, twin birds signifying good and evil were\nlocked in eternal battle.\nThe founder of Royotia saved the bird of virtue.\nIn return, he gained weapons strong enough to\ndefeat and take over the surrounding lands.\nHowever, the bird of virtue fought again with\nthe bird of evil, and lost. The founder was\nabsorbed into the evil beast.\nWhen all was almost lost, the bird of virtue\nbegan to sing a lament...a lullaby.\nUpon hearing the sad, gentle song, the bird of\nevil fell asleep and sank beneath the lava, to\nslumber for eternity.\nThat legend has been told in this land for\nhundreds of years. Still, there aren't too many\npeople interested in such fairytales nowadays.
I heard from Lord Paris that you had defeated\nthe bird of evil, Vespalia, once and for all.\nI never would have thought that the legend was\nreal...\nThe only reason Royotia still stands today is\ndue to you. I speak for the entire town when I\nsay you have our thanks.
Just before the Conqueror's army marched on\nRoyotia, the harsh sound of a bird's call could\nbe heard all through the city.\nThat legend...it wasn't just a fairytale. The\nbird of virtue's seal has broken. The bird of\nevil has awakened.\nWhether the Conqueror returns here or not,\nRoyotia is finished...
Hrmm, ain't nothing interesting goin' on at all.
Do you know Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis? Seems his\nwife's disappeared. Probably left him...it wouldn't be the\nfirst time. Or the second...

Seems like there's some crazy woman plotting to\nassassinate Duke Qubine...

An' that's the story!

Apparently there's some mystic academy that's been\nspitting out skilled magi for years.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!\nMystic academy...I've never heard of it and thus\nhave nothing to say about it. Next!
Boo...
Athlum's been going through some tough times, and\npeople are worried about the new matriarch of\nthe Honeywell clan because she's so young.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!\nThe Honeywell matriarch...obviously she, too, is one\nof my fans! ...At least, that would be nice.
Impossible!
Recently there's been gossip about Athlum's Marquis'\nlove interests...or lack thereof. He's never been\nconnected with anybody. Wonder if he's a eunuch?
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!\nMarquis of Athlum...you, too, are my rival!\n...Impressive, don't you think?

Make up your mind!

An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!\nMonster hordes...I could destroy them with a flick\nof my wrist! ...Okay, sorry. That's a lie.

Harumph harumph...harumph!\nThe Jhana...I could destroy them all myself!\n...Okay, sorry. That's a lie.
Not a funny joke!
Recently the Silver Falcons took out a pack of Jhana.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!\nThe Silver Falcons...the whole lot of them are my\nrivals! ...I'm sure at least one of them realizes this.
I'm not so sure myself...

I am Priam, Marquis of Royotia.\nYou are the fabled adventurer, then? It seems\nyou have done a lot for my people.\nI will be looking forward to your further exploits.
I am Priam, Marquis of Royotia.\nAs you can see, our fair city is surrounded on\nall sides by nature's unforgiving strength. Yet\nmy people live strong and free.\nThus I will protect them so this may always\nbe the truth.
For some reason, my body fails me of late...\nIt's as if some mysterious power is pulling at\nme...wanting me to\nNo...never mind. I just don't know what's come\nover me... This weakness is not like me.
Forgive me...you've come so far, but if you\ncould come back later it would be appreciated.
I am Priam, Marquis of Royotia.\nAs you can see, our fair city is surrounded on\nall sides by nature's unforgiving strength. Yet\nmy people live strong and free.\nI intend on protecting them from now on.
Rush. My gratitude for the Balterossa incident. Thanks to you\nand my son, we suffered much fewer losses than I'd feared.\nStill, Paris still has a lot to learn about politics. He still seems\na bit awkward with these matters of state.
Still, Paris still has a lot to learn about politics. He still seems\na bit awkward with these matters of state.
The Flame Guardian's prayers went unanswered.\nI have no more use for this key.
I am Priam, Marquis of Royotia...
For some reason, my body fails me of late...\nI just don't know what's come over me. This weakness\nis simply shameful.
Lately my son seems to be troubled by something...\nThat's just how he is... He comes across situations that\ncannot be helped and tries to help them anyway...\nParis is not like me at all...far too kind.\nJust like his mother...
I cannot believe that son of mine... The next\nleader of Royotia, and he's off gallivanting across\nthe continent?\nThough...I suppose I traveled the world before\nbecoming Marquis myself. That trip gained me\nmany things...dear friends, my beloved wife...\n*sigh* I suppose this is a great opportunity for\nhim to grow...I certainly cannot begrudge him that.
I am Paris, heir to the territory of Royotia. Our\ntown may not have much to offer, but please\nenjoy it as you can.
I'm really worried about Father...
My father's never been sick a day of his life,\nand now he's so weak he can barely stand...\nIf only we could determine the cause of this\nillness, then I could save my father from this\ntorture!
Thank you, Rush.\nIf you ever need my help, ask for me at the\nguild hall. I shall do all I can.
Father blames himself for the loss of the Emeth Tag...\nIf only there were something I could do to help\nrelieve his sorrow...
You are in the presence of the Marquis of\nRoyotia.\nPlease be silent.
The relationship between countries is very\nmuch affected by the countries that surround\nthem.
You are in the presence of the Marquis.\nPlease be silent.
It seemed like the Balterossa army\nsuffered heavy losses.
You are in the presence of Marquis Priam.\nQuiet yourself!
Master Paris and Lady Charlotte are still very young.\nI fear they will suffer many hardships in the future...
Hello.\nRush, I shall never forget your help in keeping\nRoyotia and Balterossa from war.
Rush, is there anyone you truly admire?\nI suppose my biggest hero is my father.\nFather became Marquis when he was the age I am\nnow. He was able to unite and lead the Royotian\npeople. Even after Mother died, he never faltered.\nI cannot help but look to him with pride, not\nonly as a son, but as a citizen of Royotia.
It may sound hackneyed, but my personal hero is\nmy father. I look up to him not only as a son, but as\na citizen of Royotia.
Rush... Your father is the famous Dr. Sykes, is\nhe not? Do you ever find yourself compared to him?\nMy father is a master fencer... But not only is\nhe skilled in combat, his character is such that he\nimmediately won the hearts of the people.\nCompared to that, what have I to offer? Nothing...\nI cannot help but look upon myself with shame.\nSomeone like me ought not even dream of\nbecoming a man like him...\nForgive me. I-I must be boring you.\nPlease, er, forget what I was talking about.
The more I see my father, the more unworthy I\nrealize I am...
What's this?\nIt's a brooch...a gift from my mother when I\nwas very young. It's quite old, now...\nMy mother always said the soul was like a mirror...\nThe feelings you show will always be returned.\nThus, don't meet others with anger or hatred,\nbut with kindness and charity.\nI always admired that about my mother...\nYet, kindness isn't enough to rule, is it...\nIt seems that instead of kindness, strength is\nwhat's needed to guide the people.\nAh\nForgive me. I did not mean to unload my\nthoughts on you, Rush.
For some reason, I always find myself opening my heart\nto you, Rush. It's strange...
I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I've decided\nthere's no use in trying to compare myself to Father.\nI remembered something else Mother always told me...\nEveryone has their own strengths. Instead of\ncomparing them to those of others, we must find\nhow to use them best...\nI am a different man from my father.\nThus, I must earn the trust of the Royotian people\nin my own way.\nIt's taken a long time, but in travelling with you,\nand finding my place here, I've been able to come\nto this conclusion.\nMy whole life, I've felt equally honored and cursed\nto be the future ruler of Royotia.\nFinally I feel like I can get past my insecurities and\nbegin to move forward.\nRush, please allow me to continue to journey with\nyou. I realize I have a great deal more to learn so\nthat someday, I'll be someone to be proud of...
Hello, Rush! Please continue to allow me to travel\nwith you. I still have a good deal to learn so that I\ncan be a great leader to my people.

You're awfully rude to people you've just met.
S-sorry!
Hmph... I'll let it slide this time. Of course, that's on\nthe condition that there's never a second.
Calling someone "old lady" is quite inconsiderate...\nespecially when they aren't old!
Hm? You again.

You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!\nSay, ol\nO beautiful young maid, what're you doing\naround here?

Glory to the Falcons!\nHello, Rush.\nWhat? Is it that rare for a sovani to speak to you?
What are the Silver Falcons?\n...Perhaps the most apt description is that we're a\ngroup of knights who fight for what we believe.\nIt doesn't matter if you don't fully understand.\nThere are many others in the organization, but\nnot here... Operatives carry out their own missions\nacross the continent.\nAs commander, I give directions to local operatives\nand they take care of the rest.\nGranted, there are certain inconveniences in\ncoordinating large-scale operations.\nHowever, when necessary, everyone will assemble.\nYou've no need to worry.\nOh, yes.\nIf the Falcons are called to act, would you be\nwilling to lend us your help?\nCertainly, if it was an action against your beliefs, you\ncould refuse, no questions asked. Think about it.
If the Falcons are called to act, would you be\nwilling to lend us your help?\nThink about it.
How did the Silver Falcons come to be?\nMmm... A mitra was the founder...\nThis all happened decades ago...\nAt the time, I had gone to the mountains above\nthe town to view the Tao Tie.\nAs you know, sovani are very proud beings.\nLike most of us, I had always kept to myself.\nThere was a shabby-looking sellsword who wandered\nthe area. Whenever he saw me, he'd call out a hello.\nAt the time, I found his familiarity rather impertinent...\nNot too much later, monsters assaulted the town.\nIt was terrible timing, as the army had been called\nabroad. Balterossa was thrown into a panic.\nThat's when that sellsword appeared. He gathered\nthe mercenaries of the town, and led them against\nthe monster hordes, saving the town.\nI could not understand his actions. Why would\nhe risk his life for a bunch of strangers? What\nwas his motive?\nHe caught my interest. So I decided to join him.\nHe was the first leader of the Silver Falcons.\n...\nThis story has run long. Perhaps I will continue\nit later... That's enough for now.
If the Falcons are called to act, I would appreciate\nyou lending your help.
The beastmen are tenacious enough that it is\nimpossible for the dukedoms to suppress them.\nThat is why the Silver Falcons are necessary.\nHm? Ah yes, I was in the middle of the story...\nThat sellsword who saved the town...\nThe founder of the Silver Falcons.\nHe intrigued me, and so I joined the Falcons.\nAt first, I meant just to see what made him\ntick. But after spending enough time with him,\nI began to share his beliefs.\nTo protect those who cannot protect themselves,\nwielding a blade as strong and sure as the wings\nof the proud falcon... That became my credo.\nI grew to respect him a great deal. I was curious\nto his thoughts on many different subjects.\nNevertheless, especially compared to that of a\nsovani, a mitra's lifespan is incredibly short.\n...I had tried to prepare myself. I'd attempted to...\nIt came faster than I'd imagined.\nOne night when the moon was full, the beastmen\nlaunched a sneak attack on a small village... He used\nhimself as a lure to lead them away, to the cliffs.\nAnd, there he met his end.\nHe died as he lived, selflessly acting for others...\nHe stayed true to his beliefs to the end.\n...\nIt seems I've said too much.\nYou are a strange one...\nForgive me, but I'd appreciate it if you left me\nalone right now.
Forgive me, but I'd appreciate it if I could be\nalone for a while.
For some reason, fighting alongside all of you\nreminds me of my days with the founder.\nHe taught me the value of protecting life...\nThat is why when it came time for me to take up\nthe mantle of commander, I had no doubts.\nRush...we are in a time of trial. Power, territory,\nRemnants...it seems like anything can inflame\ntensions to war nowadays.\nIf I can reduce casualties by interfering in\nthese conflicts, then I will without hesitation...\neven if it means working outside the law.\n...\nAh, now I see.\nYou're a lot like he was, Rush. That must be why\nI find myself chattering on at you so much.\nHeh, intriguing...\nI'll be curious to see where your beliefs take you...\nFeel free for that place to be the Falcons.
Rush, would you join the Silver Falcons?\nKnow that you would always be welcomed into\nour ranks.

Everything, everyone,\ngone, just like that.\nToo much power will only lead to destruction. Perhaps\nit's for the best that the Tao Tie was taken away.
[[4th level message]](after the Remnant is stolen)
What? Do you need something?
Do you need something?
Have you seen Lord David?\nI do not feel comfortable letting him alone.\nIf you see him, please tell him I am looking for him.
What a troublemaker...
...
On the surface, it does not seem like this place\nhas changed very much...\nThat said, it is no place to let Lord David run about\nunsupervised. If you see him, tell him I am looking\nfor him.
You haven't seen Lord David?
If it was only going to be stolen anyway, we should\nhave taken the Remnant ourselves...\n...No, Lord David would never have stood for it.
Please forget I said anything.
The Remnant Ark...\nSurely there must be a similar Remnant elsewhere\nin the world...
I can think of nothing...
Lord David is as prepared as he can be.\nAll I have to do is follow.
Ahh... What a spectacular Remnant.\nIt just has a certain impact, doesn't it?\nI feel as if I'd never tire of looking at it...\nHowever... The pair of them don't seem to get along\nall that well, do they...
Incredible...
...
After learning of Remnants disappearing the world over,\nI'd become a bit wary, but look. This place is the same\nas always...it's a small but appreciated blessing.
Yes, yes.
Then, it's just like Athlum...\nThe whole mood of the town is different.
What in the world is going on?\nVAL_0102_MP0:NPC:82It must exist, somewhere...
Let's continue to search.
Let's finish this...learn the true ending of this tale.
Come and check out the weapons they have!\nAhh, from blunt to sharp, fancy decorative stuff\nto everyday weapons, I love 'em all!
Heheheheh...
Lady Emma...
Heya, Rush! Check it out\nthe Remnant's still alive\nand kicking! So we can't get all down either, right?
We can't lose hope now!
Even the weapons seem kinda pooped out...\nGuess it's 'coz the Remnant's gone...
Geez, even the weapons seem pooped out...
Gah, if I have to think about this Remnant stuff any\nmore, my head's gonna explode! You just tell me\nwhere to go when you've figured it out, okay?
I'm ready to rock whenever!
Let's go, Rush!\nDon't worry\nI'll knock down anybody in our way!
What am I doing?\nJust as it looks, taking a walk. As the Marquis,\nI can't just roam the streets alone in Athlum or\nCelapaleis...\nI'm certain Torgal is having conniptions, but let's\nkeep this between us, shall we?
Remember, this is our secret.
It seems the Tao Tie is still untouched...
...
Balterossa as well...\nThen, Athlum is not the only victim...
...
What am I rushing around for?\nTo be honest, I was mainly trying not to be recognized...
I hope we're not too late...
Let's go, Rush!\nAnd we'll return together\nvictorious!
The town may look the same as always, but that's\nonly at first glance.\nThere's plenty of rumbling beneath the surface...\nThis is no time to start slacking.
This place is rotten...
They've lost their Remnant as well...\nI suppose it could be just coincidence...\nCertainly seems like a plot, though...
I can't believe someone isn't behind all this...
Hey now, quit playing around and help us search,\nwill you?  There's got to be another way to get to\nthe Sacred Lands, but we won't find it if you don't look.
Don't worry\nwe'll find it.
I'll look after Lord David since she cannot...\nSo you'd better do the same for Irina.

This is the Guild of Neutrality. Is there\nsomething you need?
Urg... Every night, I've been kept up by that\ndamned bell ringing...\nWhat the hell, didn't you know? It's the ruins\noutside of town\nMojcado Castle.\nCenturies ago, it was this beautiful silver\ncastle. The ruler did all sorts of rituals there,\nwas celebrated in song, yadda yadda.\nOf course, now it's all run down, overrun by\nmonsters. That's just how it goes.\nThing is, in the middle of the castle is this\nhuge belltower. Sometimes it'll ring at night,\neven though the place's deserted...\nUgh, gives me the creeps!
The desert's plenty dangerous, but it's worth\nbravin' it for all the treasure hidden out there.\nRumor going 'round the guild is that beneath\nthe Great Sand Sea is the ruins of the greatest\nof the Old Kingdoms\nthe Kingdom of Glenys.\nWhat I'd give to get even a look at that loot...

Welcome to Café Moondust.
Hey there, didja know? There's a city even past the\ngreat desert.\nAt the southern tip of the world, sitting at the base\nof Mt. Altona is a town of hardy\nif pigheaded\nminers.
What, you want to know what's in the western desert?\nThe old adventurers used to say that west of the west\nwas a forgotten town. But no one knows if it's true or\nnot\nno one's ever come back from there alive.\nMmm, I wouldn't waste my time worrying about that\nplace. I would never allow my daughter to go there,\neither!
Every time I see Zolean in here, he's drinking alone.\nIt's weird, because he was in here with the same friend\nfor years. Wonder what happened to the other guy?
What is it, son? Are you thinking you want to cross\nthe desert?\nThe Great Sand Sea's home to monsters you won't find\nanywhere else in the world\nand the rest of the world\nis all the luckier for it!\nIf you've really got your heart set on going out there,\nmake sure you're amply prepared.
What's the critter sitting outside? That's my\npartner, of course!\nTraveling merchants like us make our way by\ntakin' a wide range of goods back and forth\nacross the desert.\nIt's a harsh trip, but with my faithful companion\nby my side, the journey ain't so bad.\nWhoa, there, pardner, hold yer horses. No\nmatter how much you offer, I ain't about to let\nmy faithful steed go!
Hey, pardner, didja hear?\nThe boss o' this here country's been sick fer a\nlong spell, an' ain't any o' the medicines\nhelpin' a lick.\nWhile on the range, I rode into another country,\nan' they were singin' a similar song.\nReckon this bug is only hittin' royal-types?\nThat sure don't sound too likely, though...
...\n.........\nWhat? Don'tcha know when ta leave a cowpoke\nalone? ...Though I reckon there ain't no more\nuse in avoidin' it...\nE'er since the Tao Tie disappeared, Balterossa's\nbecome a ghost town. The dealers ain't comin'\nthrough, and my business's gone to the dogs.\nTo square old debts, I even had to sell my\nfaithful companion...\n*sniffle* If...if I could just see 'im again,\nmake sure he's bein' treated right...!
Lots of girls are huge fans of Lady Charlotte.\nThe minute she's seen wearing anything,\nsimilar fashions start flying off store shelves.\nIn a word, she's like the town's idol.\n*sigh* I'm jealous...I wish everyone would try\nand emulate me!
Did you hear the latest about Lady Charlotte?\nApparently she broke up with her boyfriend!\nIt's the absolute latest news.\nAnd when you hear who it was, you're going to\nflip. It was the son of Royotia's Marquis, Paris!\nI mean, seriously, that man is fine. And you\nknow he's gotta be a passionate and skilled\nlover.\n*sigh* If it were me, there'd be no way I'd let\na catch like that go!
Have you heard the latest about Lady Charlotte?\nApparently she got back together with her\nboyfriend, Paris. I guess she rethought letting\nsuch a hunk get away.\nOh, and get this\ntheir feelings for each other\nwere so strong that they were able to keep us\nand Royotia from going to war!\n*sigh* I want to hook up with a sensitive\nhottie like that...
A thousand years ago, there was a prosperous\ncountry in the middle of the desert. The guard\nthat protected it was unmatched in skill.\nThat strength threatened the Imperator, and he\nset his armies against them. When the dust\ncleared, the desert country was destroyed.\nHowever...the spirits of the warriors from the\ndefeated land still lurk within the desert's\nsands, awaiting the perfect time for revenge...\nMy great-grandfather first told me that tale\nwhen I was just a little boy. Man, was I spooked!\nI was always home by dark after that!\nEven now, I don't like to go to the\nbathroom alone... Eheheh.
I really worry for Lady Bertrude... She is deathly\nill, and getting worse every day.\nFor her to go from standing proudly at the head\nof our country to lying in a sickbed... How could\nthis happen?\nOr\ncould it be...?\nThe curse of the felled warriors of the ancient\ndesert kingdom...?\nIs it possible there was truth to that story...?\n...Ugh, I don't want to think about it!
A half-year previous, a legion of monsters\nattacked the city. Never in all my years had I\nseen so many beasts at once...\nA Silver Falcon said the monsters had come\nfrom deep in the desert, where a certain beast\nwas summoning them as part of a curse.\nIt could call unlimited reinforcements, so the\nbattle would be unimaginably fierce.\nWithout a doubt, this must be the work of the\nangry spirits left from the ancient kingdom of\nthe desert...\nAwaking in this time, they seek revenge by\nsending monsters against the lands of the God\nEmperor...\nGoodness gracious, to think that the legend of\nthe Kingdom of Glenys was true...
The Silver Falcons have sworn to protect order\nacross the continent. We act without regard for\nborders\nthere is only one world, after all.\nWe are currently in the middle of an important\nstrategy session. Please don't interrupt.
Oh, you again.\nHeard about you from the commander.\nGranted, you don't look like much, but I hear\nyou're not too shabby with a sword.\nNext time we have an anti-monster operation,\njoin us. Lately, we need all the help we can get.
Hi, Rush!\nSorry for being so rude before.\nI heard the commander was so impressed by\nyou that he decided to join you on your journey.\nAll of us Falcons have taken an oath to the\norganization, to protect it and uphold what it\nstands for.\nTell Commander Caedmon that he doesn't have\nto worry about us! The Falcons will still be here\nwhen he comes back.
These two twin girls came by earlier, and the\nwhite-haired one left this key. I don't have\nany use for it, so if you want it, it's yours.
Oh, it's you.\nA space away from the heat and hustle and bustle\nof outside... I like this place.
Ah, you...\nI feel like I've forgotten something important yet again...\nOr perhaps it's just my imagination...
I feel like I've forgotten something very important...\nBut perhaps it's just my imagination...
Of late the vision of a strange woman has been\ncoming to me...\nA girl with a mischievous smile and long, graceful\nfingers... She draws near and strokes my cheek, and...\nHahaha... Perhaps the desert heat is going to my head.\nMen who spend all their time at war have no time\nfor exploits of a romantic nature, yes?
Of late I've been struck with memories of a woman\nI don't know. Odd...a man who spends his days\nfighting as I do has no time for romance...
Oh, Rush.\nI think I've been able to remember more, vaguely...\nWe were together...I and that woman...\nShe was brilliant\nbright, uncompromising...\nAs intense as the desert sun.\nWe were sitting near the water...\nThe reflection of her smile sparkled off the surface\nof the river.\n...River? Or perhaps it was a canal?\nWhere could all of this have happened?\nCurses, I remember all but the most crucial parts...
Who was that woman?\nDamn, I cannot recall anything...\nI think it was near a canal, but...
Hello, Rush.\nI've decided.\nI'm going to find that woman.\nI haven't regained all of my memories of her, but\nI cannot help but think I must meet with her.\nI thought myself to be someone with no passion in\nlife except for the battlefield, but it seems there was\nsomething\nrather, someone else important to me.\nI still don't even know where to begin my search,\nbut I'm sure these memories will come with time.\nSo, Rush, I would like to travel with you for a little\nlonger. I feel like my travels with you will help me\nregain memories.
Hello, Rush.\nI feel I'm on the verge of remembering a little more.
Good to see you, son.\nI've just been here having a drink with an old friend.
Oho, our fearless leader.\nHas something so dire come up that you need the\nservices of this old man?\nWhen it comes to battle, the experiences of fighters\nlike me can be a good reference. Every so often young\nwarriors such as yourself come to me for advice.\nBut just now I was having a drink with a good friend.\nHe and I have been coming to this pub for a long,\nlong time. It's long been our spot to have a drink\nafter a battle. Next time, why don't you join us?\nAhh, but you're still young yet, aren't you. That\nMarquis of Athlum would have my head for leading\nyou into temptation...ha ha ha.
My friend and I have been coming to this pub for\na long, long time. We relax here with a drink after\nevery battle.
You want to know about my friend?\nAhh... I suppose this starts what, thirty, forty\nyears back? We met on the battlefield.\nWe were both fresh recruits, shaking in our scales\nto be in the middle of a real battle... We ended up\ncheering each other on.\nEver since then, we were comrades in arms...\nand rivals, at times.\nBut, you know, it's not like we're getting any younger.\nNowadays we spend a good deal more time meeting\nin places like this than anything else...ha ha ha.
My friend is an old war buddy of mine. Nowadays\nwe spend a good deal more time meeting and drinking\nhere than anything else, though.
Heyyy, good timing!\nI was just talking about you.\nZane, here\nthis's Rush!\nHm?\nWhere the devil'd he go? Can't believe he sneaked\noff again...left me with the bill, to boot.\nI swear Zane was right here a minute ago.\nRgh, he always does this...disappears right when\nI need him. Like that time in Siebenbur...\nAhh, you know what, I think maybe I've had a li'l\ntoo much to drink... *hic*
Can't believe Zane just up and disappeared like that...\nJust like in Siebenbur, he just...\n*hic*
What? That's...that's Zane's!\nAh. Ahh, you found it...\n...\nThree years ago...\nThere was a big operation to clean the beastmen\narmies out of Siebenbur.\nZane was in charge of one of the main squads.\nHe knew the beast leader had to be taken down.\nSo he went after them...but didn't come back.\nIn the end, we beat back the beastmen. I didn't\nhear about Zane until it was all over.\nI couldn't believe it...I wouldn't believe Zane was\ngone until I could see it with my own eyes.\nI thought, if I came here, to the pub we always met\nat, he'd eventually show up... I've been waiting ever\nsince.\nI suppose I've been afraid to accept the truth...\nBut, seeing that ring, I can't run from reality any longer.\nAnd...I think that finally, I'm alright with that.\nIt seems that even old as I am, I still need to work\non my discipline. ...Thank you, Rush.\nAny time this old man can be of use, just say the\nword. I'll help in any way I can.
Hello there, young one.\nAny time this old man can be of use, just say the\nword. I'll help in any way I can.
Welcome! Please make yourself at home.
If you touch my daughter you'll be joining\nthe Duchess's harem of eunuchs.\nSo make yourself comfortable!
Do you know Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis? Rumor has it\nthat his wife has run away from him. In fact, the couple\nis infamous for not getting along, so no one is surprised...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
What in the world is the baron doing? The most\nimportant thing a man can do is take care of\nthe home! Darling daughter, you agree, right?
Er, of course!
I don't want to believe it, but the rumor is that there's\na woman plotting to assassinate Duke Qubine...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Assassination... What a dangerous world this has\nbecome! Beloved daughter, I think I'll have to\nmake your curfew earlier...
I...I see...
Apparently the desert princess has been sneaking out\nof the castle to meet her lover.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Ohh, I completely sympathize with her mother.\nEvery parent wants to keep their daughter near.\nBeloved daughter, you'd better stay at home for a while!
I...I see...
The desert princess has eloped!
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Whaaat!? That girl's poor parents! I hope they find\nthat beast of a man and hang him for the crime of\nstealing a young girl's innocence!
Daddy, calm down!
Relations between Balterossa and Royotia have really\ngone downhill. Families of soldiers are getting worried\nsince the armies are being mobilized...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Ugh, this is all due to that lecherous fiend who stole\naway the princess. What an impressive list of crimes...\nBeloved daughter, I'm sure you agree.
Er, of course!
So there's supposed to be something the Imperator\nsealed out in the great swamp, but now the seal is\nbroken. Maybe it's the entrance to another world...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Once one enters another world, most likely they can't\nreturn. Alright, beloved daughter, don't go to the swamp\nuntil I say so!
O-okay...
Apparently one of the Forest Maidens bound to\na knight of the Order of Melphina can sense\nwhat he's sensing.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Knights sworn to protect maidens... Perhaps I should\nfind my beloved daughter a knight as well... No\nthis\nis my duty. Daddy will protect you with his life!
Er, thank you.
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina\nare mobilizing... Seems something's happened to\nthe Last Leaf in Crookfen.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, seems the swamp has become more and more\ndangerous. I can't have you going near it... Beloved\ndaughter, you mustn't leave the town for a while.
A-alright...
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, but apparently\nthe Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to Nagapur yet.\nMaybe she got mixed up in something...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Kosmosfest... Beloved daughter, if you are very good,\nthen Daddy will take you to see it!
Yay...
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started\nthe Kosmosfest alright, but then it was interrupted\nby monsters.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Whaaat!? Monsters at the festival!? No, no, this won't\ndo. Too dangerous! Sorry, beloved daughter, but\nDaddy can't put you in that sort of danger.
O-oh...
An old-fashioned lady is looking to hire bodyguards,\nI hear. She's supposed to be hanging out at the pub\nnear the canal.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Old-fashioned, hm? Beloved daughter, that is exactly\nthe sort of look you should cultivate! Yes, become\nold-fashioned for Daddy, alright?
A-alright...
Do you like antiques?\nApparently a lot of the treasures of the Old Kingdoms\nare turning up on the black market.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, the black market... My beloved daughter doesn't\nneed to be thinking about things like that! Alright,\nforget what you just said, alright, dear?
O-okay...
There's a man looking for three very important stones\nin the desert. Apparently they're very historically\nsignificant.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
There are many secrets hidden within the desert\nwastes. Beloved daughter, study up on the rich history\njust outside your door!
O-okay...
A man interested in ancient magick is looking for\npeople to help out with research. Seems he's on\nthe verge of unlocking some huge mysteries.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Magick and mysteries...\nIt is an intriguing offer\nI would go and help\nbut\nI cannot leave my daughter's side.
Apparently there's a scary monster that was sealed\nby one of the God Emperors, but came back...\nPeople say the whole world is in danger!
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, the world is in danger... Don't worry, dear.\nDaddy will protect you, even if it costs him his life...
Daddy...
Some amnesiac is wandering around the cities in\nthe desert, looking for something that could regain\nhis memory.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
To lose all one's memories...how terrible. If my\nbeloved daughter were to completely forget me,\nI don't know what I'd do...my life would be over!
Daddy, calm down!
Recently people have been seeing an infamous bandit\naround Athlum. Apparently he's waiting around for\nsomeone but no one's brave enough to ask who.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
A bandit...not only dangerous, but a man...\nNo, no, no, this won't do. I forbid you from even\ngetting near Athlum, alright, dear?
O-okay...
There's a goddess statue in the Robelia Ruins that's\nsupposed to let you meet anyone in the world.\nSomeone who lost his sister is looking for it...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
What an amazing statue!\nBeloved daughter, promise me that if we are ever\nseparated you will use that statue to find me.
O-okay...
There's a murderer on the loose in the capital!
That's the latest news, Daddy.
A murderer\nin the capital!? ...Where is this "capital"?\nIt...it couldn't be here, is it? That's it, I forbid you to\ntake even one step out of the house!
O-oh...
There's a really big yama who needs help searching\nfor things... But he's a little...touched, so people have\nbeen trying to keep out of his way.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Lost items...a pity. But look, honey, if you ever lose\nanything at all, you come tell me first, alright?\nDaddy will find it for you, no matter what.
A-alright...
Some white qsiti's been looking for a magickal book.\nPeople seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's\nbeen able to place him.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Magickal tomes... I studied the intricacies of ancient\nmagicks when I was young. Beloved daughter, if you\nhave interest in the subject, then study it well!
A-alright...
A set of twins have turned up as mercenaries lately,\nreally capable ones. Apparently they're really pretty,\nbut maybe a little standoffish.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm... I don't want to seem sexist, but mercenaries are\nalways putting their life on the line... No, daughter,\nI believe I must forbid you from becoming one!
O-okay...
A man in the Great Sand Sea's been looking for\nchallengers for some sort of game. But apparently\nhe only wants really special people to play.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Some "game" with some man!? No, oh no.\nThat's it, daughter, I forbid you from going to the desert.\nDon't even get close!
A-alright...
Some elderly warrior's been crossing the Great\nSand Sea, looking for a special sword.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
An elderly man searching for a sword...\nIt must hold incredible significance to him.\nYou understand, my daughter?
Y-yes...
The guards of Ghor have all sworn to follow their ruler\nfor as long as they live.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Mmm... With a guard that dedicated, the ruler must\ncertainly be great. Beloved daughter, you may go to\nthat town any time.
Y-yay...
There's not a family in the world as dedicated as\nthe Honeywells. If you've got them at your back,\nyou can do anything.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
The matriarch of the Honeywells is indeed a formidable\nwoman. But being a warrior is too dangerous for\nmy daughter! I forbid you from becoming one!
A-alright...
Apparently Athlum's General Torgal is supposed to\nhave some things in his past that're coming back\nto haunt him, centered in Royotia...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Something from the general's past...hrm.\nBeloved daughter, I forbid you from getting close to\nmen with troubled pasts, alright?
O-okay...
The legendary fighting tourney is about to start.\nAnyone with fighting spirit is invited to participate.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Legendary it may be, it's still dangerous. I forbid you\nfrom watching such violence! ...You weren't thinking\nof participating, were you!?
N-no...
Apparently there's some mystic academy that's been\ntraining skilled magi for years.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Ohh, how nostalgic! The academy is my alma mater,\nyou know. It would be a fine school for you as well,\nbeloved daughter.
O-okay...
Athlum's been going through some tough times, and\npeople are worried about the new matriarch of\nthe Honeywell clan because she's so young.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
It must be tough... To lose her mother, then take up\na sword all alone... Beloved daughter, when I die, I forbid\nyou from becoming a swordswoman!
O-okay...
Recently there's been gossip about Athlum's Marquis's\nlove interests...or lack thereof.\nHe's never been connected with anybody.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, and he is that age... Alright, beloved daughter,\nI forbid you from going to Athlum for a while!
O-okay...
The old head of the Academy's been seen in pubs\nacross the continent lately. I guess anyone would\nwant to drown their sorrows after what happened.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
The Academy's former director? Is that a man or\na woman? If it's a man, I know one pub he won't be\ngoing to!
O-okay...
Dr. Sykes has been seen going in and out of Athlum\nCastle often lately. Maybe they've made some sort\nof discovery?
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Oh, a new discovery from the famed scientists...\nintriguing. Beloved daughter, shall we take a trip to\nAthlum to see what the fuss is about?
A-alright...
Some unidentified flying object's been spotted\nswooping around Wyrmskeep. Apparently people\nare really frightened.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Unidentified flying object!? No, no, far too dangerous!\nI forbid you from even going close to Nagapur!
O-okay...
Some hot-blooded female warrior is trying to hunt down\nthat group causing trouble in Crookfen. But it's against\nher boss's wishes...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
There is nothing wrong with a bit of a tomboy, but if\nshe's too hot-blooded, it just leads to trouble...\nPromise me, daughter, that you will never act so rashly!
A-alright...
A monster army has appeared in the Great Sand Sea\nand is threatening Balterossa. They're so powerful...it\nseems like we're in trouble.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Mmm, there is no reason to go to the Great Sand Sea...\nI will make certain I don't have any errands that would\nsend you there, beloved daughter.
According to ancient historians, there's something\ndangerous enough to destroy entire cities sealed\nwithin the volcano...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Inside the volcano... If it were to cause an eruption,\nthere would be nowhere to run. Alright, daughter,\nI forbid you from getting close to the volcano!
O-okay...
No one knows anything about what's going on inside\nthe volcano... But, the Marquis of Royotia might have\nsome ideas.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
It seems the volcano has not ceased being dangerous.\nI know you don't have a reason to go there, but you are\nstill forbidden to go to the volcano!
O-okay...
You know there's a town without anyone running it?\nThe old ruler's sons are fighting over the seat of power.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, sounds like a very dangerous place to me.\nBeloved daughter, I forbid you from going to any town\nwithout a ruler!
O-okay...
When you're out in the desert, you can hear this sad,\nlonely voice crying from beneath the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Cries from the desert floor... That sounds suspicious no\nmatter how you slice it! Daughter, even if you go to\nthe Great Sand Sea, I forbid you from going beneath it!
O-okay...
A long time ago, there used to be a famed hero that\nlived in the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
A famed hero...a famed male hero!? I don't care how\nlong ago it was, I forbid you from going to the Great\nSand Sea! Don't even get near it!
A-alright...
So I was walking through town and heard a man all\n"you gotta believe me! If you look at the pillars in\nthe Great Sand Sea, then...g-g-gra\n!"
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Ho? I have no idea what that means, but it sounds\nsuspicious! Beloved daughter, I forbid you from going to\nthe Great Sand Sea!
O-okay...
A mad scientist has been wandering around Melphina.\nIf you go over there, you probably should stay away,\nhe's giving people strange looks.
That's the latest news, Daddy.

Well met, traveler.\nI have heard tales of what you've done.\nI am grateful for your service to Balterossa.\nI look forward to your further exploits.
Welcome, traveler. You have done well to\nmake your way through the great desert.\nI am Bertrude di Balterossa.\nI trust you've visited our market?\nI am certain you'll be impressed by the various\nrare items offered for sale there.
Lately it seems my body will not agree to my\nspirit's wishes... It's almost as if some strange\npower tries to control me...\nTh-this wave...could it be...
Forgive me, but I must rest. If your dealings\ncan wait, then please return later.
I give my thanks for all that you've done.
However, I will not be revealing the details of\nthis plot to the public. I have my own idea of\nthe culprit. Now, to spin a web to catch them...
My daughter has made the right choice in\nreturning to me. I will not accept her dallying\nwith that man.
In the end the incident with Royotia came to a...touching\nconclusion. Certainly, using the two of them required more\nthan a little care.\nNevertheless, in the end it became a good bargaining chip.
You have my thanks for your hard work.\nWithout your assistance, Balterossa would truly have\nno future.
Welcome, traveler. You have done well to make your way\nthrough the great desert.\nI am Bertrude di Balterossa...
Recently my body has felt dull and sluggish...\nNever before have I experienced such fatigue.
I am Charlotte, the heir to Balterossa. It is a\npleasure to make your acquaintance.\nIf you've any questions about this land,\nplease do not hesitate to ask.
Mother's face looks so pale and drawn these days...
My mother's illness has lasted for a long time.\nIt seems as if there's nothing I can do for her...\nJust waiting and watching while she suffers so\nis too much for me to bear.
I am sorry I've caused Mother such trouble.\nYet Paris is a wonderful man...
Mother only wants what's best for me. She\nraised me herself... I cannot betray her trust.\nIf only he could understand...
Did you hear?\nMother has allowed Paris and I to court!
I heard it was a terribly harsh battle...\nThere are no words to express how thankful I am\nfor what you've done.
You stand before the Lady Bertrude!\nMind your manners.
I'm almost certain I've seen the man Lady\nCharlotte was meeting before... If only I could\nremember where?
Lady Bertrude is quite stoic about it, but this\nbusiness with her daughter really pains her.
Sometimes I believe ignorance really is bliss...\nEspecially in things political...
Sir Rush. Well done on the battlefield.
You stand before the Duchess of Balterossa!\nWatch your tongue.
The Duchess was at her wits' end while the\nLady Charlotte was away.
Thank heavens, the Lady Charlotte has returned\nsafely. The Duchess is very relieved.
It seems the Royotian Guard suffered many losses.
I hope to become more like you, Sir Rush.
You are in the presence of Lady Bertrude of\nBalterossa! Mind your manners.
Lady Charlotte often goes to have her fortune\ntold. It seems to bring her great happiness.
To think, the Lady Charlotte was exposed to\nsuch danger... This is a blight to the honor of\nBalterossa.
Sir Paris will be the next Marquis of Royotia.\nI can't begin to imagine the pressure Lady\nCharlotte faces.
It is difficult work, bringing the desert's past to light,\nbut I believe a brave and determined youth like\nyou could find the whole truth.

Wait. Look at this.
Listen when I talk to you.\nYou should take a look at this.
What is that?
It's a treasure chest\na type of Remnant.\nThey're not that uncommon.
Remnant, huh...
There could be any number of things inside.\nFind out\nbind it.
Bind? What do you mean?
You have to "bind" a Remnant to use it.\nIn this case, just reach out your hand and\nask it to show you what's inside.\nIt's simple enough that even you can do it\nso\nlong as someone else hasn't bound it first.
A sword, hm? I suppose you can keep that.\nYou won't be quite as useless.
Quiet.
Is that what you were fighting before?
Yes, monsters.\nIt looks like we can't avoid them.\nLet's initiate a battle before they spot us.
What are you waiting around for?\nHurry and initiate a battle.
You're too close! They'll spot you!
Damn, they noticed us.\nI thought I told you to initiate a battle!
Damn, they're too close!
